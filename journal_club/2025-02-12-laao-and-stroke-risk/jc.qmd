## Left atrial appendage?

- Primordial atrium derivation from pulmonary bud fusion into the primitive LA
- LAA is 2-fold more compliant than LA, and acts like a decompression chamber (thus exclusion leads to decreased reservoir function)
- LAA also secretes majority of atrial natriuretic peptide

## Anatomy {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Diagram of LAA anatomy](garg-2024-laa-anatomy.png){#fig-laa-anatomy}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Anatomical position:
    - pulmonary arteries (superior)
    - left ventricle free wall (inferomedial) 
    - left circumflex coronary artery (LAA ostium)
    - left phrenic nerve (posterolateral)
    - left superior pulmonary vein (posterior)
    - mitral valve (inferior)
- 4 parts = ostium, neck, body, and tip
- Ostium is oval-shaped (can be triangular or teardrop)
- Body described by morphology: chicken wing, windsock, broccoli, cactus

## Procedural safety {.smaller}

1. *EWOLUTION* by @Turagam2019 (Watchman) $\rightarrow$ showed low ischemic stroke risk peri-procedurally without OAC therapy
1. *PINNACLE FLX* by @Kar2021 (Watchman FLX) $\rightarrow$ showed 99% safety of implant and <1% ischemic stroke risk (7 days of follow-up), with mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc = 4$ 

## Future CVA risk {.smaller}

1. *ASAP* by @Reddy2013 (Watchman) $\rightarrow$ pLAAO in those intolerant to VKA had reduced CVA risk from 7% (based on $CHADS_{2}$) to 2%
1. *PROTECT AF* by @Reddy2014 (Watchman) $\rightarrow$ noninferiority RCT of pLAAO v. VKA, with pLAAO being *safer* than VKA, however low event rate and primary endpoints were composite MACE (e.g. ischemic stroke risk was 1.4 vs. 1.1 events (per 100 patient-years) in device v. VKA)
1. *PREVAIL* by @Holmes2014 (Watchman) $\rightarrow$ non-inferiority between pLAAO and VKA, showing non-inferiority, mean $CHADS_{2} = 2$
1. *PRAGUE-17* by @Osmancik2020 (Watchman, FLX, & Amulet) $\rightarrow$ non-inferiority of pLAAO v. DOAC, with mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc = 5$

## Reduction in CVA risk?

Anticoagulation alone reduced CVA risk by 50-70%

. . .

Difficult to ascertain true incidence because these scores likely **underestimate** risk.

. . .

::: {.r-fit-text}
Does pLAAO truly reduce risk to 1-2%?
:::

## Device complications

Peri-device leaks are generally described as residual communications between the LA and LAA body behind the LAAO device.

. . .

Device-related thrombus is usually seen on any exposed metal hubs of pLAAO devices or exposed LA surfaces, and usually affected by the shape of that surface (e.g. differences between Amulet and Watchman).

@Garg2024
:::

## PDLs {.smaller}

About a quarter of pLAAO had PDL at 1 year...

- 1st generation of pLAAO had rates of PDL between 30-40% 
- 2nd generation about 15%-20% risk (Watchman FLX)

PDL usually categorized by size, with small being <3 mm to <5 mm in size. 

. . .

**PDLs increase the risk of ischemic stroke by ~2 fold**, in follow-up data from the *NCDR LAAO Registry* and *PROTECT-AF*


::: {.attribution}
@Alkhouli2023; @Dukkipati2022
:::

## DRTs {.smaller}

Rates of DRT...

- In *PROTECT-AF*, *PREVAIL*, and *CAP* registries was approximately 4% by 2 years
- *EUROC-DRT* approximately 18% in 1st year

. . .

**Increases risk of stroke by 3- to 5-fold, with 7-fold risk of hemorrhagic stroke**

. . .

This was not seen in the *EWOLUTION* registry.

@Dukkipati2018; @Alkhouli2018; @Turagam2019
:::

## PDLs and DRTs in CVA risk

. . .

::: {.r-fit-text}
**PDL increases the risk category for 25% of implants to the 2-3% CVA incidence **
:::

. . .

::: {.r-fit-text}
**DRT increases the risk category for 5-10% of implants to the 20-30% CVA incidence **
:::

. . .

*Candidates for these studies were predominantly deemed to not be candidates for OAC, leading to increased bleeding risk if OAC was forced to be restarted.*

## Modifiable factors?

- PDL can theoretically be sealed by plugs and RF energy
- Rhythm maintenance, with persistent AF increasing risk
- Implanting > 1 cm deep from PV ridge

# Occlusion Devices with PVI {background-color='{{< brand color primary >}}'}

## Coupling of procedures

- Rhythm control with ablation does decrease stroke risk if sinus is maintained
- Device placement can make challenging ablation due to altered anatomy (not studied with PFA)
- LAA isolation can potentially reduce AF burden by removing potential trigger, however may worsen heart failure

## OPTION

- RCT of n=1600 individuals after PVI to pLAAO v. OAC
- Mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc = 3.5$
- Primary safety end-point = major, non-procedural bleeding
  - n=65 in pLAAO arm and n=137 in OAC arm
- Primary efficacy end-point = ischemic stroke
  - n=41 in pLAAO arm and n=44 in OAC arm
- LAAO had lower bleeding rates, and similar thromboembolic rates

## COMBINATION

- RCT of n=200 participants randomized to single-procedure PVI and pLAAO, with either pLAAO first or second
- Mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc = 4$
- Primary end-point = risk of ischemic stroke
- Secondary end-point = risk of AF recurrence
- If pLAAO was implanted first, risk of future AF and rates of PDL and DRT was lower

. . .

Feasibility and safety of combined procedure supported in by other groups (@Preisendorfer2024).

## Considerations {.smaller}

- $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc \ge 4$ to provide adequate stroke risk reduction
- Candidates for PVI with RF energy
- Ability to address acute PDL and reduce risk for DRT by acheiving sinus
- pLAAO before PFA ablation has not been well studied (complicated by catheter touching device struts)
- Ridge anatomy and edema with ablation
- pLAAO prior to ablation as first line strategy?
- *Authors for majority of trials are the same, with similar disclosures to Watchman and Amulet parent companies*
