# Introduction

### Objectives

1. Be aware of the history of pharmacological therapies for improving myocardial inotropy

1. Obtain a general background in the cellular mechanics of myocardial contractility 

1. Understand the process of phases of drug development

1. Understand the methods and statistical techniques in survival analysis and mixed models.

1. Critically assess the results of a randomized clinical trial

---

### Systolic Heart Failure

- Characterized from dysfunction or loss of cardiomyocytes, resulting in...
	- Reduced contractility
	- Increased cardiac wall stress
- Compensatory mechanisms include:
	- neurohormal activation (both acute autonomic changes and persistent hormonal changes)
	- ventricular remodeling (leading to a *negative feedback cycle* of ever increasing myocardial oxygen demand and decreased efficiency)
	
<font size="5">
.center[Majority of drugs focus on blocking neurohormonal activation and remodeling, not on improving systolic function directly]

| Drug | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dobutamine | $\beta$-adrenergy leads to cAMP-based phosphorylation of L-type $Ca$ channels and ryanodine receptors |
| Ibopamine | dopamine and $\alpha$ agonist with mild $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ agonism | 
| Xamoterol | $\beta_{1}$ selective/partial agonist |
| Milrinone, pimobendan, enoximone, vesnarinone | phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors increase contractility by decreasing cAMP degradation, bypassing $\beta$-receptor, also potent vasodilator | 
| Flosequinan | increased cardiac contractility to reduce $Na/Ca$ exchange | 
| Levosimendan | increases cardiac myofilament $Ca$ sensitivity | 
| Istaroxime | inhibits $Na/K$ ATP-ase but also stimulates sarcoplasmic reticulum $Ca$ release |
| Digitalis/dixogin | inhibits $Na/K$ ATPase, increasing both intracellular sodium and $Ca$; decreases conduction through AV node through prolonged phase 4 and 0
| Hawthorn (crategus) extract | cAMP-independent inhibition of $Na/K$ ATPase, decreases nitric oxide degradation |

| Indication | Effect |
| :- | :------------- |
| $\downarrow$CO from AMI | Dobutamine - without shock <br> Dopamine - with shock <br> *All causes increased $O_{2}$ consumption, arrhythmia, infarct* |
| CHF | Dobutamine - desensitization can occur <br> Milrinone - more pulmonary vasodilation <br> Levosimendan - potential mortality benefit over dobutamine <br> *Mortaliy of 80-90% in 1 year* |
| Cardiac Arrest | Epinephrine, vasopressin <br> |

## Omecamtiv Mecarbil

Why do we need *another* drug?

- All prior increased mortality (except for digoxin)
- Similar mechanism of increased intracellular calcium and calcium sensitivity
- **Hypothesis**: direct activation of human sarcomere could augment contractility without similar adverse effects

What is **OM**?

- selective cardiac myosin activator
- increases myocardial contractility by binding to myosin at allosteric stie
- stabilizes lever arm of cardiac myosin in primed position
- increased myosin heads primed for powerstroke prior to contraction
- increased force generated 
- decreases ATP turnover
- no changes in $Ca$ currents

.pull-right[

- Systolic pressures $<$ 85 mm Hg or $>$ 140 mm Hg*
- Indexed GFR $\leq$ 20 mL/min
- Heart rate $>$ 110 beats/min or $<$ 50 beats/min
]

.footnote[*Higher systolic pressures suggest patient had not been optimized]

---

### Trial Design

- Randomized in 1:1 ratio of **OM** or **placebo**, with intent-to-treat analysis
- Balanced blocks within strata of enrollment location (inpatient v. outpatient)
- Dosage:
  - Either 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg 
  - Dosage based on clearance (plasma levels checked)
  - Post-randomization checks performed at 2-16 week intervals (increasing)
  - Dosing held temporarily in those with ACS

### Outcomes

- Primary: first heart-failure event* or CV death composite
- Secondary: CV death, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), all-cause mortality, MACE

.footnote[*Defined as initiation or intensification of heart failure treatment. ]

---

## Statistics

- To achieve 90% power to detect $HR=0.80$, expected $N=8000$ subjects and $N=1600$ events
- $\alpha$ spending function with **Haybittle-Peto** approach, with final $\alpha=0.05$
- Evaluated time-to-event using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models
  - Major exposure was trial drug (either **OM** or **placebo**)
  - Stratified with baseline hazards by randomization setting, geographic region
  - Adjusted for baseline GFR
- KCCQ symptom change evaluated using mixed models 
  - Fixed effects: baseline KCCQ, geographic region, GFR, visit, trial group, and interaction between trial group and visit
  - Random effects: randomization setting, repeat visits

---

.pull-left[
### Multiple Hypotheses
- Multiple interim analyses, and multiple secondary outcomes, lead to multiple hypothesis testing
- $\alpha$ can be "spent" in several ways to lead to an overall $\alpha=0.05$ 
- Using *Haybittle-Peto boundary*, can adjust p-value for overall testing
- In this study, 96% of the $\alpha$ was spent on CV death, and 4% on KCCQ/symptom burden, thus a final $\alpha=0.05$ was used
]

.pull-right[
![alpha spending](haybittle-peto.png)
]

---

### Cox Proportional Hazard Models

$$ 
h(t) = h_{0}(t) ^ {\beta1 X1}
$$

- Assumes baseline hazard is proportional between groups
- Covariates are not assumed to vary with time (e.g. GFR is presumed to stay stable)
- Baseline hazard can be stratified 

.center[*Limitations*]

- The hazard is not necessarily proportional, as age and comorbidities are not encompassed
- The hazard ratio may actually be exponential (e.g. **Weibull** distribution - worsening HF will lead to increased events at an accelerating rate)

---

### Mixed Effect Models

- International study with different population/treatment strategies; inpatient/outpatient populations of different risk pools
- Using these as *random effects*, can measure the effect of the intervention and controlling for the differences in populations
- Allows for different slopes (or $\beta$ coefficients) by group

## Key Findings

<font size="6">
Overall, **OM** had 8% lower RR, with an ARR of 2.1%, over 3 years.  

In NYHA $\geq$ III, **OM** had 12% lower RR

NT-proBNP at 6 months was 10% lower with **OM**

With **OM**, had 32% lower RR for stroke, with 0.9% ARR

## Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Generalizability
- Excluded those over > 85 years of age
- Excluded those with clinical instability
- Only 7% were Black
- Only 21% were women
]

.pull-right[
#### Context
- SGLT2 inhibitors were not compelling at time of enrollment (only 2% usage)
- Calcitropic agents were studied in times of limited GDMT 
- Systolic heart failure now has more nuance than prior studies have evaluated e.g. ICM vs. NICM
]

.pull-left[
#### Which subjects benefited the most? 

1. Inpatients with elevated NT-proBNP
1. North Americans (non-Hispanic)
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy
1. Normal sinus rhythm
1. Severely reduced EF $\leq$ 28% and NYHA III-IV
1. eGFR $>$ 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>
1. ACEI (*not ARB/ARNI*) therapy
1. CRT/ICD therapy

#### Which did not?

1. Western Europeans, South Africans, Australians
1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter
1. LVEF $>$ 28%
]

--

.pull-right[
#### **Why?**

- Symptomatic patients with worse contractility
- More severe cardiomyopathy
- Localized myocardiocyte damage (not global) from ischemia
- Decreased LV thrombus burden due to decreased LV strain
- Sinus rhythm allows for physiological ventricular filling
- Stable kidney function allows for improved/effective diuresis from concomitant GDMT
