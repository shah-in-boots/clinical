abstract = {Background: This study describes the process and outcomes of continuous outpatient support with inotropes (COSI) in patients with Stage D heart failure (HF). Although Stage D HF has recently been defined as end-stage disease requiring special interventions for survival such as COSI or ventricular assist devices, concern has been raised regarding the safety, efficacy, mortality outcomes, and ethics of COSI. Methods and Results: Inotrope dependence was defined as worsening of the patient's clinical status with attempted inotrope withdrawal such that the patient was deemed unlikely to survive to permit hospital discharge. A care process for COSI was designed; baseline and outcome variables were evaluated. COSI was administered to 36 inotrope-dependent patients (age 55.4 ± 9.5 years, 24 males). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were consistent with Stage D HF: left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 ± 8.5, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 70 ± 10 mm, systolic blood pressure 97.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.5 ± 0.6, serum sodium 131.7 ± 5.3; 69 HF hospitalizations (mean 1.9 ± 1.8) 6 months before COSI initiation. Symptomatic hypotension, increasing dyspnea, renal dysfunction, and hypoperfusion most commonly prevented inotrope withdrawal. Despite Stage D HF, patients were discharged with COSI ambulatory, oriented, and pain free. Rehospitalizations were 46; 6 subjects accounted for 24 hospitalizations; 23 had 0 or 1 rehospitalization. Median survival was 3.4 months (range 0.2.26.3 months); and 3-, 6-, and 12-month Kaplan Meier survival was 51{\%}, 26{\%}, and 6{\%}, respectively. The majority of patients died at home and chose to not undergo resuscitation attempts. Conclusion: COSI may be an acceptable treatment option for Stage D HF.},

abstract = {Background There are two approaches to the treat- ment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both ap- proaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recom- mended. Methods We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in pa- tients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results A total of 4060 patients (mean [±SD] age, 69.7±9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 per- cent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normal- ized ratio was subtherapeutic. Conclusions Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advan- tage over the rate-control strategy, and there are po- tential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoag- ulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients. (N},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Among patients with heart failure who have mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dysfunction, the prognosis is poor. Transcatheter mitral-valve repair may improve their clinical outcomes. METHODS At 78 sites in the United States and Canada, we enrolled patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy (device group) or medical therapy alone (control group). The primary effectiveness end point was all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months of follow-up. The primary safety end point was freedom from device-related complications at 12 months; the rate for this end point was compared with a prespecified objective performance goal of 88.0{\%}. RESULTS Of the 614 patients who were enrolled in the trial, 302 were assigned to the device group and 312 to the control group. The annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months was 35.8{\%} per patient-year in the device group as compared with 67.9{\%} per patient-year in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.70; P{\textless}0.001). The rate of freedom from device-related complications at 12 months was 96.6{\%} (lower 95{\%} confidence limit, 94.8{\%}; P{\textless}0.001 for comparison with the performance goal). Death from any cause within 24 months occurred in 29.1{\%} of the patients in the device group as compared with 46.1{\%} in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, transcatheter mitral-valve repair resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure and lower all-cause mortality within 24 months of follow-up than medical therapy alone. The rate of freedom from device-related complications exceeded a prespecified safety threshold. (Funded by Abbott; COAPT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01626079 .).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use. METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. RESULTS: In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236±1440 and 4373±1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05±0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4±26.5 ?mol per liter] and 0.07±0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430±1401 vs. 4171±1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08±0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04±0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

abstract = {Aims: Electrical cardioversion is commonly performed to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is unsuccessful in 10-12{\%} of attempts. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel cardioversion protocol for this arrhythmia. Methods and results: Consecutive elective cardioversion attempts for AF between October 2012 and July 2017 at a tertiary cardiovascular centre before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) implementing the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol (OAFCP) as an institutional initiative in July 2015 were evaluated. The primary outcome was cardioversion success, defined as ≥2 consecutive sinus beats or atrial-paced beats in patients with implanted cardiac devices. Secondary outcomes were first shock success, sustained success (sinus or atrial-paced rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to discharge from hospital), and procedural complications. Cardioversion was successful in 459/500 (91.8{\%}) in Phase I compared with 386/389 (99.2{\%}) in Phase II (P {\textless} 0.001). This improvement persisted after adjusting for age, body mass index, amiodarone use, and transthoracic impedance using modified Poisson regression [adjusted relative risk 1.08, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11; P {\textless} 0.001] and when analysed as an interrupted time series (change in level +9.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI 6.8-12.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). The OAFCP was also associated with greater first shock success (88.4{\%} vs. 79.2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and sustained success (91.6{\%} vs 84.7{\%}; P=0.002). No serious complications occurred. Conclusion: Implementing the OAFCP was associated with a 7.4{\%} absolute increase in cardioversion success and increases in first shock and sustained success without serious procedural complications. Its use could safely improve cardioversion success in patients with AF. Clinical trial number: www.clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02192957.},

Methods and Results - This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York Heart Association II to III, and left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}40{\%} within the past 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end point. All-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 60{\%}-78{\%}) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after an average of 1.4±0.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 25{\%}-44{\%}) in group 2 (log-rank P{\textless}0.001). The success rate of CA in the different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29{\%} to 61{\%}. After adjusting for covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-4.3; P{\textless}0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 [31{\%}] in group 1 and 58 [57{\%}] in group 2; P{\textless}0.001), showing 45{\%} relative risk reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.39-0.76). A significantly lower mortality was observed in CA (8 [8{\%}] versus AMIO (18 [18{\%}]; P=0.037). Conclusions - This multicenter randomized study shows that CA of AF is superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at long-term follow-up and reducing unplanned hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure and persistent AF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite improvements in the management of atrial fibrillation, patients with this condition remain at increased risk for cardiovascular complications. It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk. METHODS In this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated. RESULTS In 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96{\%} confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9{\%} of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4{\%} of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

abstract = {The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown. {\textcopyright} 1989, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Arruda1998,
abstract = {Introduction: Delta wave morphology correlates with the site of ventricular insertion of accessory AV pathways. Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location. Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V1 (classified as R ≤ S or R {\textless} S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90{\%} and specificity was 99{\%}. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75{\%}, specificity 99{\%}), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 98{\%}) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 100{\%}). Conclusion: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.},

abstract = {A central factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction is the initial decrease in systolic function. Prior attempts at increasing cardiac contractility with oral drugs have uniformly resulted in signals of increased mortality at pharmacologically effective doses. Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel, selective cardiac myosin activator that has been shown to improve cardiac function and to decrease ventricular volumes, heart rate, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) trial tests the hypotheses that omecamtiv mecarbil can safely improve symptoms, prevent clinical HF events, and delay CV death in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. More than 8,000 patients with chronic symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35{\%}, elevated natriuretic peptides, and either current hospitalization for HF or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for HF within a year of screening will be randomized to either oral placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil employing a pharmacokinetic-guided dose titration strategy using doses of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy outcome is the time to cardiovascular death or first HF event. The study has 90{\%} power to assess a final hazard ratio of approximately 0.80 in cardiovascular death, the first secondary outcome. The GALACTIC-HF trial is the first trial examining whether selectively increasing cardiac contractility in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction will result in improved clinical outcomes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is common practice to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27{\%}) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25{\%}) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32{\%} in the rhythm-control group and 33{\%} in the rate-control group), stroke (3{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively), worsening heart failure (28{\%} and 31{\%}), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43{\%} and 46{\%}). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a routine strategy of rhythm control does not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate-control strategy.

abstract = {Background Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a selective cardiac myosin activator that increases myocardial function in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic heart failure. Objectives This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of OM in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Methods Patients admitted for AHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40{\%}, dyspnea, and elevated plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides were randomized to receive a double-blind, 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo or OM in 3 sequential, escalating-dose cohorts. Results In 606 patients, OM did not improve the primary endpoint of dyspnea relief (3 OM dose groups and pooled placebo: placebo, 41{\%}; OM cohort 1, 42{\%}; cohort 2, 47{\%}; cohort 3, 51{\%}; p = 0.33) or any of the secondary outcomes studied. In supplemental, pre-specified analyses, OM resulted in greater dyspnea relief at 48 h (placebo, 37{\%} vs. OM, 51{\%}; p = 0.034) and through 5 days (p = 0.038) in the high-dose cohort. OM exerted plasma concentration-related increases in left ventricular systolic ejection time (p {\textless} 0.0001) and decreases in end-systolic dimension (p {\textless} 0.05). The adverse event profile and tolerability of OM were similar to those of placebo, without increases in ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Plasma troponin concentrations were higher in OM-treated patients compared with placebo (median difference at 48 h, 0.004 ng/ml), but with no obvious relationship with OM concentration (p = 0.95). Conclusions In patients with AHF, intravenous OM did not meet the primary endpoint of dyspnea improvement, but it was generally well tolerated, it increased systolic ejection time, and it may have improved dyspnea in the high-dose group.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5{\%}] vs. 82 patients [44.6{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4{\%}] vs. 46 [25.0{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7{\%}] vs. 66 [35.9{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2{\%}] vs. 41 [22.3{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95{\%} CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of coronary-artery revascularization before elective major vascular surgery is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients at increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications and clinically significant coronary artery disease to undergo either revascularization or no revascularization before elective major vascular surgery. The primary end point was long-term mortality. RESULTS: Of 5859 patients scheduled for vascular operations at 18 Veterans Affairs medical centers, 510 (9 percent) were eligible for the study and were randomly assigned to either coronary-artery revascularization before surgery or no revascularization before surgery. The indications for a vascular operation were an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 percent) or arterial occlusive disease of the legs (67 percent). Among the patients assigned to preoperative coronary-artery revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 59 percent, and bypass surgery was performed in 41 percent. The median time from randomization to vascular surgery was 54 days in the revascularization group and 18 days in the group not undergoing revascularization (P{\textless}0.001). At 2.7 years after randomization, mortality in the revascularization group was 22 percent and in the no-revascularization group 23 percent (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). Within 30 days after the vascular operation, a postoperative myocardial infarction, defined by elevated troponin levels, occurred in 12 percent of the revascularization group and 14 percent of the no-revascularization group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery does not significantly alter the long-term outcome. On the basis of these data, a strategy of coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery among patients with stable cardiac symptoms cannot be recommended.

abstract = {Context: Because acute decompensated heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a need for agents that at least improve hemodynamics and relieve symptoms without adversely affecting survival. Objective: To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004. Interventions: Intravenous levosimendan (n=664) or intravenous dobutamine (n=663). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at 180 days. Results: All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26{\%}) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28{\%}) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.74-1.13; P=.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P{\textless}.001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group. Conclusion: Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

We assessed the pharmacokinetics and effects on cardiac function and structure of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil. Methods In this randomised, double-blind study, done at 87 sites in 13 countries, we recruited patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction 40{\%} or lower. Patients were randomly assigned equally, via an interactive web response system, to receive 25 mg oral omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily (fixed-dose group), 25 mg twice daily titrated to 50 mg twice daily guided by pharmacokinetics (pharmacokinetic-titration group), or placebo for 20 weeks. We assessed the maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil in plasma (primary endpoint) and changes in cardiac function and ventricular diameters. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786512. Findings From March 17, 2014, to March 5, 2015, we enrolled 150 patients in the fixed-dose omecamtiv mecarbil group and 149 in the pharmacokinetic-titration and placebo groups. Mean maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil at 12 weeks was 200 (SD 71) ng/mL in the fixed-dose group and 318 (129) ng/mL in the pharmacokinetic-titration group. For the pharmacokinetic-titration group versus placebo group at 20 weeks, least square mean differences were as follows: systolic ejection time 25 ms (95{\%} CI 18–32, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), stroke volume 3{\textperiodcentered}6 mL (0{\textperiodcentered}5–6{\textperiodcentered}7, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0217), left ventricular end-systolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}8 mm (−2{\textperiodcentered}9 to −0{\textperiodcentered}6, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0027), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}3 mm, (−2{\textperiodcentered}3 to 0{\textperiodcentered}3, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0128), heart rate −3{\textperiodcentered}0 beats per min (−5{\textperiodcentered}1 to −0{\textperiodcentered}8, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0070), and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide concentration in plasma −970 pg/mL (−1672 to −268, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0069). The frequency of adverse clinical events did not differ between groups. Interpretation Omecamtiv mecarbil dosing guided by pharmacokinetics achieved plasma concentrations associated with improved cardiac function and decreased ventricular diameter. Funding Amgen.},

abstract = {Background: Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitiser, improves myocardial contractility without causing an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. We compared the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on haemodynamic performance and clinical outcome in patients with low-output heart failure. Methods: Patients were recruited into a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. Under continuous haemodynamic monitoring, an initial loading dose of levosimendan of 24 $\mu$g/kg was infused over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 $\mu$gkg-1 min-1 for 24 h. Dobutamine was infused for 24 h at an initial dose of 5 $\mu$g kg-1 min-1 without a loading dose. The infusion rate was doubled if the response was inadequate at 2h. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with haemodynamic improvement (defined as an increase of 30{\%} or more in cardiac output and a decrease of 25{\%} or more in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) at 24 h. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings: 103 patients were assigned levosimendan and 100 dobutamine. The primary haemodynamic endpoint was achieved in 29 (28{\%}) levosimendan-group patients and 15 (15{\%}) in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio 1.9 [95{\%} CI 1.1-3.3]; p=0.022). At 180 days, 27 (26{\%}) levosimendan-group patients had died, compared with 38 (38{\%}) in the dobutamine group (0.57 [0.34-0.95]; p=0.029). Interpretation: In patients with severe, low-output heart failure, levosimendan improved haemodynamic performance more effectively than dobutamine. This benefit was accompanied by lower mortality in the levosimendan group than in the dobutamine group for up to 180 days.},

abstract = {Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs when the RV fails to maintain enough blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to achieve adequate left ventricular filling. This can occur suddenly in a previously healthy heart due to massive pulmonary embolism or right-sided myocardial infarction, but many cases encountered in the intensive care unit involve worsening of compensated RV failure in the setting of chronic heart and lung disease. Management of RV failure is directed at optimizing right-sided filling pressures and reducing afterload. Due to a lower level of vascular tone, vasoactive medications have less salient effects on reducing vascular resistance in the pulmonary than in the systemic circulation. Successful management requires reversal of any conditions that heighten pulmonary vascular tone and the use of selective pulmonary vasodilators at doses that do not induce systemic hypotension or worsening of oxygenation. Systemic systolic arterial pressure should be kept close to RV systolic pressure to maintain RV perfusion. When these efforts fail, the judicious use of inotropic agents may help improve RV contractility enough to maintain cardiac output. Extracorporeal life support is increasingly being used to support patients with acute RV failure who fail to respond to medical management while the underlying cause of their RV failure is addressed.

@article{Hirao1996,
abstract = {Background: Differentiation between ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction over an accessory AV pathway (AP) and the AV node (AVN) may be difficult, especially in patients with a septal AP. Methods and Results: A new pacing method, para-Hisian pacing, was tested in 149 patients with AP and 53 patients without AP who had AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Ventricular pacing was performed adjacent to the His bundle and proximal right bundle branch (HB-RB), initially at high output to capture both RV and HB-RB. The output was then decreased to lose HB-RB capture. The change in timing and sequence of retrograde atrial activation between HB-RB capture and noncapture was examined. Loss of HB-RB capture without change in stimulus- atrial (S-A) interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AP conduction. An increase in S-A interval without change in His bundle-atrial interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AVN conduction. A change in atrial activation sequence indicated the presence of both retrograde AP and AVN conduction. Para-Hisian pacing correctly identified retrograde AP conduction in 132 of 147 AP patients, including all septal and right free wall APs. Retrograde AVN conduction masked AP conduction in 9 of 34 patients with a left free wall AP and 6 of 9 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Para-Hisian pacing correctly excluded AP conduction in all 53 patients with AVNRT. Conclusions: Para-Hisian pacing reliably identifies retrograde conduction over septal and right free wall APs, but AVN conduction may mask APs located far from the pacing site or with a long retrograde conduction time.},

abstract = {Impaired left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with an increased risk of death. Despite recent advances in the management of these patients, sudden death accounts for up to 50{\%} of this mortality, and effective treatment strategies have yet to be identified. Preliminary trials with amiodarone have offered promise that drugs that prolong action potential duration by blocking the potassium channel may be useful in reducing this mortality. The Survival With Oral d-Sotalol (SWORD) trial is a multicenter, multinational study which tests the hypothesis that the class III agent d-sotalol will reduce all-cause mortality in high-risk survivors of AMI. The trial will enroll 6,400 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤40{\%}) and a recent (6 to 42 days) or a remote ({\textgreater}42 days) AMI with overt heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III). In approximately 500 centers throughout the world, men and women aged ≥18 years will be enrolled and randomized to placebo or d-sotalol (200 mg/day). The minimal follow-up will be 18 months. The trial has a 90{\%} power to detect a 20{\%} reduction in all-cause mortality. The rationale, design, and trial methods are described. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Spatial dispersion of repolarization in the form of transmural, trans-septal and apico-basal dispersion of repolarization creates voltage gradients that inscribe the J wave and T wave of the EGG. Amplification of this spatial dispersion of repolarization (SDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited or acquired ion channelopathies giving rise to the long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS). This review focuses on the role of spatial dispersion of repolarization in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis associated with the long QT and BrS. In the long QT syndrome, drug-induced amplification of SDR is often secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) of M cells, whereas in the BrS, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the APD of right ventricular epicardium. Among the challenges ahead is the identification of a means to quantitate SDR non-invasively. This review also discusses the value of the interval between the peak and end of the T wave (Tpeak-Tend, Tp-Te) as an index of SDR and transmural dispersion of repolarization, in particular.

abstract = {Importance: Catheter ablation is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effects on long-term mortality and stroke risk are uncertain. Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2{\%} female; 42.9{\%} had paroxysmal AF and 57.1{\%} had persistent AF), 89.3{\%} completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8{\%}) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5{\%}) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0{\%} (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2{\%} (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95{\%} CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2{\%} vs 6.1{\%} for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95{\%} CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7{\%} vs 58.1{\%} for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95{\%} CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9{\%} vs 69.5{\%} for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that even among patients who experience a complete normalization of LV ejection fraction, a significant proportion will develop recurrent LV dysfunction accompanied by recurrent heart failure events. This has led to intense interest in understanding how to manage patients with heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecEF). Because of the lack of a standard definition for HFrecEF, and the paucity of clinical data with respect to the natural history of HFrecEF patients, there are no current guidelines on how these patients should be followed up and managed. Accordingly, this JACC Scientific Expert Panel reviews the biology of reverse LV remodeling and the clinical course of patients with HFrecEF, as well as provides guidelines for defining, diagnosing, and managing patients with HFrecEF.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in patients with congestive heart failure and commonly results in clinical deterioration and hospitalization. Sinus rhythm may be maintained with antiarrhythmic drugs, but some of these drugs increase the risk of death. Methods: We studied 1518 patients-with symptomatic congestive heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 34 Danish hospitals. We randomly assigned 762 patients to receive dofetilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, and 756 to receive placebo in a double-blind study. Treatment was initiated in the hospital and included three days of cardiac monitoring and dose adjustment. The primary end point was death from any cause. Results: During a median follow-up of 18 months, 311 patients in the dofetilide group (41 percent) and 317 patients in the placebo group (42 percent) died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.11). Treatment with dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure (risk ratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.89). Dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. After one month, 22 of 190 patients with atrial fibrillation at base line (12 percent) had sinus rhythm restored with dofetilide, as compared with only 3 of 201 patients (1 percent) given placebo. Once sinus rhythm was restored, dofetilide was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm (hazard ratio for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001). There were 25 cases of torsade de pointes in the dofetilide group (3.3 percent) as corn pared with none in the placebo group. Conclusions: In patients with congestive heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation, preventing its recurrence, and reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Dofetilide had no effect on mortality.},
