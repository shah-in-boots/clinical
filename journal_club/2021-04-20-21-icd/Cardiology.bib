abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), except in those with completely reversible causes. We sought to examine the impact of ICD therapy on mortality in survivors of SCA associated with reversible causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the records of 1433 patients managed at our institution between 2000 and 2012 who were discharged alive after SCA. A reversible and correctable cause was identified in 792 (55{\%}) patients. Reversible SCA cause was defined as significant electrolyte or metabolic abnormality, evidence of acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, recent initiation of antiarrhythmic drug or illicit drug use, or other reversible circumstances. Of the 792 SCA survivors because of a reversible and correctable cause (age 61±15 years, 40{\%} women), 207 (26{\%}) patients received an ICD after their index SCA. During a mean follow-up of 3.8±3.1 years, 319 (40{\%}) patients died. ICD implantation was highly associated with lower all-cause mortality (P{\textless}0.001) even after correcting for unbalanced baseline characteristics (P{\textless}0.001). In subgroup analyses, only patients whose SCA was not associated with myocardial infarction extracted benefit from ICD (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of SCA because of a reversible and correctable cause, ICD therapy is associated with lower all-cause mortality except if the SCA was because of myocardial infarction. These data deserve further investigation in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial, as they may have important and immediate clinical implications.},

abstract = {Introduction: Delta wave morphology correlates with the site of ventricular insertion of accessory AV pathways. Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location. Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V1 (classified as R ≤ S or R {\textless} S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90{\%} and specificity was 99{\%}. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75{\%}, specificity 99{\%}), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 98{\%}) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 100{\%}). Conclusion: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy are at substantial risk for sudden death from cardiac causes. However, the value of prophylactic implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden death in such patients is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 458 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36 percent, and premature ventricular complexes or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A total of 229 patients were randomly assigned to receive standard medical therapy, and 229 to receive standard medical therapy plus a single-chamber ICD. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a mean (±SD) of 29.0±14.4 months. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 21 percent. The vast majority of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (86 percent) and beta-blockers (85 percent). There were 68 deaths: 28 in the ICD group, as compared with 40 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 1.06; P=0.08). The mortality rate at two years was 14.1 percent in the standard-therapy group (annual mortality rate, 7 percent) and 7.9 percent in the ICD group. There were 17 sudden deaths from arrhythmia: 3 in the ICD group, as compared with 14 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95 percentconfidence interval, 0.06 to 0.71; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were treated with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator significantly reduced the risk of sudden death from arrhythmia and was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death from any cause.},

abstract = {Background - Whether catheter ablation (CA) is superior to amiodarone (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure is unknown. Methods and Results - This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York Heart Association II to III, and left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}40{\%} within the past 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end point. All-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 60{\%}-78{\%}) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after an average of 1.4±0.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 25{\%}-44{\%}) in group 2 (log-rank P{\textless}0.001). The success rate of CA in the different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29{\%} to 61{\%}. After adjusting for covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-4.3; P{\textless}0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 [31{\%}] in group 1 and 58 [57{\%}] in group 2; P{\textless}0.001), showing 45{\%} relative risk reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.39-0.76). A significantly lower mortality was observed in CA (8 [8{\%}] versus AMIO (18 [18{\%}]; P=0.037). Conclusions - This multicenter randomized study shows that CA of AF is superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at long-term follow-up and reducing unplanned hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure and persistent AF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sudden death from cardiac causes remains a leading cause of death among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proposed to improve the prognosis in such patients. METHODS We randomly assigned 2521 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 percent or less to conventional therapy for CHF plus placebo (847 patients), conventional therapy plus amiodarone (845 patients), or conventional therapy plus a conservatively programmed, shock-only, single-lead ICD (829 patients). Placebo and amiodarone were administered in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was death from any cause. RESULTS The median LVEF in patients was 25 percent; 70 percent were in NYHA class II, and 30 percent were in class III CHF. The cause of CHF was ischemic in 52 percent and nonischemic in 48 percent. The median follow-up was 45.5 months. There were 244 deaths (29 percent) in the placebo group, 240 (28 percent) in the amiodarone group, and 182 (22 percent) in the ICD group. As compared with placebo, amiodarone was associated with a similar risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.06; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P=0.53) and ICD therapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 23 percent (0.77; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.007) and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population. Results did not vary according to either ischemic or nonischemic causes of CHF, but they did vary according to the NYHA class. CONCLUSIONS In patients with NYHA class II or III CHF and LVEF of 35 percent or less, amiodarone has no favorable effect on survival, whereas single-lead, shock-only ICD therapy reduces overall mortality by 23 percent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite improvements in the management of atrial fibrillation, patients with this condition remain at increased risk for cardiovascular complications. It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk. METHODS In this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated. RESULTS In 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96{\%} confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9{\%} of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4{\%} of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

abstract = {The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown. {\textcopyright} 1989, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with reduced left ventricular function after myocardial infarction are at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. This randomized trial was designed to evaluate the effect of an implantable defibrillator on survival in such patients. METHODS Over the course of four years, we enrolled 1232 patients with a prior myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.30 or less. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive an implantable defibrillator (742 patients) or conventional medical therapy (490 patients). Invasive electrophysiological testing for risk stratification was not required. Death from any cause was the end point. RESULTS The clinical characteristics at base line and the prevalence of medication use at the time of the last follow-up visit were similar in the two treatment groups. During an average follow-up of 20 months, the mortality rates were 19.8 percent in the conventional-therapy group and 14.2 percent in the defibrillator group. The hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in the defibrillator group as compared with the conventional-therapy group was 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.93; P=0.016). The effect of defibrillator therapy on survival was similar in subgroup analyses stratified according to age, sex, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, and the QRS interval. CONCLUSIONS In patients with a prior myocardial infarction and advanced left ventricular dysfunction, prophylactic implantation of a defibrillator improves survival and should be considered as a recommended therapy.},

abstract = {A central factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction is the initial decrease in systolic function. Prior attempts at increasing cardiac contractility with oral drugs have uniformly resulted in signals of increased mortality at pharmacologically effective doses. Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel, selective cardiac myosin activator that has been shown to improve cardiac function and to decrease ventricular volumes, heart rate, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) trial tests the hypotheses that omecamtiv mecarbil can safely improve symptoms, prevent clinical HF events, and delay CV death in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. More than 8,000 patients with chronic symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35{\%}, elevated natriuretic peptides, and either current hospitalization for HF or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for HF within a year of screening will be randomized to either oral placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil employing a pharmacokinetic-guided dose titration strategy using doses of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy outcome is the time to cardiovascular death or first HF event. The study has 90{\%} power to assess a final hazard ratio of approximately 0.80 in cardiovascular death, the first secondary outcome. The GALACTIC-HF trial is the first trial examining whether selectively increasing cardiac contractility in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction will result in improved clinical outcomes.

Defined as chronic angina-type chest pain in the presence of myocardial ischaemia that persists despite optimal medical, interventional and surgical treatment, current therapies are limited and new approaches to treatment are needed. With an ageing population and increased survival from coronary artery disease, clinicians will increasingly encounter this complex condition in routine clinical practice. Novel therapies to target myocardial ischaemia in patients with refractory angina are at the forefront of research and in this review we discuss those in clinical translation and assess the evidence behind their efficacy.},

abstract = {Background - Patients surviving ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are at a high risk of death due to a recurrence of arrhythmia. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) terminates VT or VF, but it is not known whether this device prolongs life in these patients compared with medical therapy with amiodarone. Methods and Results - A total of 659 patients with resuscitated VF or VT or with unmonitored syncope were randomly assigned to treatment with the ICD or with amiodarone. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was arrhythmic death. A total of 328 patients were randomized to receive an ICD. A thoracotomy was done in 33, no ICD was implanted in 18, and the rest had a nonthoracotomy ICD. All 331 patients randomized to amiodarone received it initially. At 5 years, 85.4{\%} of patients assigned to amiodarone were still receiving it at a mean dose of 255 mg/day, 28.1{\%} of ICD patients were also receiving amiodarone, and 21.4{\%} of amiodarone patients had received an ICD. A nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death was observed with the ICD, from 10.2{\%} per year to 8.3{\%} per year (19.7{\%} relative risk reduction; 95{\%} confidence interval, -7.7{\%} to 40{\%}; P = 0.142). A nonsignificant reduction in the risk of arrhythmic death was observed, from 4.5{\%} per year to 3.0{\%} per year (32.8{\%} relative risk reduction; 95{\%} confidence interval, -7.2{\%} to 57.8{\%}; P = 0.094). Conclusions - A 20{\%} relative risk reduction occurred in all-cause mortality and a 33{\%} reduction occurred in arrhythmic mortality with ICD therapy compared with amiodarone; this reduction did not reach statistical significance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of coronary-artery revascularization before elective major vascular surgery is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients at increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications and clinically significant coronary artery disease to undergo either revascularization or no revascularization before elective major vascular surgery. The primary end point was long-term mortality. RESULTS: Of 5859 patients scheduled for vascular operations at 18 Veterans Affairs medical centers, 510 (9 percent) were eligible for the study and were randomly assigned to either coronary-artery revascularization before surgery or no revascularization before surgery. The indications for a vascular operation were an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 percent) or arterial occlusive disease of the legs (67 percent). Among the patients assigned to preoperative coronary-artery revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 59 percent, and bypass surgery was performed in 41 percent. The median time from randomization to vascular surgery was 54 days in the revascularization group and 18 days in the group not undergoing revascularization (P{\textless}0.001). At 2.7 years after randomization, mortality in the revascularization group was 22 percent and in the no-revascularization group 23 percent (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). Within 30 days after the vascular operation, a postoperative myocardial infarction, defined by elevated troponin levels, occurred in 12 percent of the revascularization group and 14 percent of the no-revascularization group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery does not significantly alter the long-term outcome. On the basis of these data, a strategy of coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery among patients with stable cardiac symptoms cannot be recommended.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5{\%}] vs. 82 patients [44.6{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4{\%}] vs. 46 [25.0{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7{\%}] vs. 66 [35.9{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2{\%}] vs. 41 [22.3{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95{\%} CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

abstract = {Background: This study describes the process and outcomes of continuous outpatient support with inotropes (COSI) in patients with Stage D heart failure (HF). Although Stage D HF has recently been defined as end-stage disease requiring special interventions for survival such as COSI or ventricular assist devices, concern has been raised regarding the safety, efficacy, mortality outcomes, and ethics of COSI. Methods and Results: Inotrope dependence was defined as worsening of the patient's clinical status with attempted inotrope withdrawal such that the patient was deemed unlikely to survive to permit hospital discharge. A care process for COSI was designed; baseline and outcome variables were evaluated. COSI was administered to 36 inotrope-dependent patients (age 55.4 ± 9.5 years, 24 males). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were consistent with Stage D HF: left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 ± 8.5, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 70 ± 10 mm, systolic blood pressure 97.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.5 ± 0.6, serum sodium 131.7 ± 5.3; 69 HF hospitalizations (mean 1.9 ± 1.8) 6 months before COSI initiation. Symptomatic hypotension, increasing dyspnea, renal dysfunction, and hypoperfusion most commonly prevented inotrope withdrawal. Despite Stage D HF, patients were discharged with COSI ambulatory, oriented, and pain free. Rehospitalizations were 46; 6 subjects accounted for 24 hospitalizations; 23 had 0 or 1 rehospitalization. Median survival was 3.4 months (range 0.2.26.3 months); and 3-, 6-, and 12-month Kaplan Meier survival was 51{\%}, 26{\%}, and 6{\%}, respectively. The majority of patients died at home and chose to not undergo resuscitation attempts. Conclusion: COSI may be an acceptable treatment option for Stage D HF.},

abstract = {Background: Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitiser, improves myocardial contractility without causing an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. We compared the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on haemodynamic performance and clinical outcome in patients with low-output heart failure. Methods: Patients were recruited into a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. Under continuous haemodynamic monitoring, an initial loading dose of levosimendan of 24 $\mu$g/kg was infused over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 $\mu$gkg-1 min-1 for 24 h. Dobutamine was infused for 24 h at an initial dose of 5 $\mu$g kg-1 min-1 without a loading dose. The infusion rate was doubled if the response was inadequate at 2h. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with haemodynamic improvement (defined as an increase of 30{\%} or more in cardiac output and a decrease of 25{\%} or more in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) at 24 h. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings: 103 patients were assigned levosimendan and 100 dobutamine. The primary haemodynamic endpoint was achieved in 29 (28{\%}) levosimendan-group patients and 15 (15{\%}) in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio 1.9 [95{\%} CI 1.1-3.3]; p=0.022). At 180 days, 27 (26{\%}) levosimendan-group patients had died, compared with 38 (38{\%}) in the dobutamine group (0.57 [0.34-0.95]; p=0.029). Interpretation: In patients with severe, low-output heart failure, levosimendan improved haemodynamic performance more effectively than dobutamine. This benefit was accompanied by lower mortality in the levosimendan group than in the dobutamine group for up to 180 days.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is common practice to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27{\%}) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25{\%}) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32{\%} in the rhythm-control group and 33{\%} in the rate-control group), stroke (3{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively), worsening heart failure (28{\%} and 31{\%}), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43{\%} and 46{\%}). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a routine strategy of rhythm control does not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate-control strategy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with coronary heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and abnormalities on signal-averaged electrocardiograms have an increased risk sudden death. We evaluated the effect on survival of the prophylactic implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators in such patients at the time of coronary-artery bypass surgery. METHODS Over the course of five years, 37 clinical centers screened all patients who were scheduled for elective coronary bypass surgery. Patients were eligible for the trial if they were less than 80 years old, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 0.36, and had abnormalities on signal-averaged electrocardiograms. We identified 1422 eligible patients, enrolled 1055, and randomly assigned 900 to therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (446 patients) or to the control group (454 patients). The primary end point of the study was overall mortality, and the two groups were compared in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS The base-line characteristics of the two groups were similar. During an average follow-up of 32+/-16 months, there were 101 deaths in the defibrillator group (71 from cardiac causes) and 95 in the control group (72 from cardiac causes). The hazard ratio for death from any cause was 1.07 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.42; P=0.64). There was no statistically significant interaction between defibrillator therapy and any of 10 preselected base-line covariates. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of improved survival among patients with coronary heart disease, a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, and an abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram in whom a defibrillator was implanted prophylactically at the time of elective coronary bypass surgery.},

abstract = {Context: Because acute decompensated heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a need for agents that at least improve hemodynamics and relieve symptoms without adversely affecting survival. Objective: To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004. Interventions: Intravenous levosimendan (n=664) or intravenous dobutamine (n=663). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at 180 days. Results: All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26{\%}) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28{\%}) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.74-1.13; P=.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P{\textless}.001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group. Conclusion: Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Background - We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized comparison of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy in survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to documented ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and Results - From 1987, eligible patients were randomized to an ICD, amiodarone, propafenone, or metoprolol (ICD versus antiarrhythmic agents randomization ratio 1:3). Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March 1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61{\%} higher all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3 months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57±34 months, the crude death rates were 36.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 26.9{\%} to 46.6{\%}) in the ICD and 44.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 37.2{\%} to 51.8{\%}) in the amiodarone/metoprolol arm. Overall survival was higher, though not significantly, in patients assigned to ICD than in those assigned to drug therapy (1-sided P=0.081, hazard ratio 0.766, [97.5{\%} CI upper bound 1.112]). In ICD patients, the percent reductions in all-cause mortality were 41.9{\%}, 39.3{\%}, 28.4{\%}, 27.7{\%}, 22.8{\%}, 11.4{\%}, 9.1{\%}, 10.6{\%}, and 24.7{\%} at years 1 to 9 of follow-up. Conclusions - During long-term follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors, therapy with an ICD is associated with a 23{\%} (nonsignificant) reduction of all-cause mortality rates when compared with treatment with amiodarone/metoprolol. The benefit of ICD therapy is more evident during the first 5 years after the index event.},

Objectives This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of OM in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Methods Patients admitted for AHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40{\%}, dyspnea, and elevated plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides were randomized to receive a double-blind, 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo or OM in 3 sequential, escalating-dose cohorts. Results In 606 patients, OM did not improve the primary endpoint of dyspnea relief (3 OM dose groups and pooled placebo: placebo, 41{\%}; OM cohort 1, 42{\%}; cohort 2, 47{\%}; cohort 3, 51{\%}; p = 0.33) or any of the secondary outcomes studied. In supplemental, pre-specified analyses, OM resulted in greater dyspnea relief at 48 h (placebo, 37{\%} vs. OM, 51{\%}; p = 0.034) and through 5 days (p = 0.038) in the high-dose cohort. OM exerted plasma concentration-related increases in left ventricular systolic ejection time (p {\textless} 0.0001) and decreases in end-systolic dimension (p {\textless} 0.05). The adverse event profile and tolerability of OM were similar to those of placebo, without increases in ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Plasma troponin concentrations were higher in OM-treated patients compared with placebo (median difference at 48 h, 0.004 ng/ml), but with no obvious relationship with OM concentration (p = 0.95). Conclusions In patients with AHF, intravenous OM did not meet the primary endpoint of dyspnea improvement, but it was generally well tolerated, it increased systolic ejection time, and it may have improved dyspnea in the high-dose group.

abstract = {Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs when the RV fails to maintain enough blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to achieve adequate left ventricular filling. This can occur suddenly in a previously healthy heart due to massive pulmonary embolism or right-sided myocardial infarction, but many cases encountered in the intensive care unit involve worsening of compensated RV failure in the setting of chronic heart and lung disease. Management of RV failure is directed at optimizing right-sided filling pressures and reducing afterload. Due to a lower level of vascular tone, vasoactive medications have less salient effects on reducing vascular resistance in the pulmonary than in the systemic circulation. Successful management requires reversal of any conditions that heighten pulmonary vascular tone and the use of selective pulmonary vasodilators at doses that do not induce systemic hypotension or worsening of oxygenation. Systemic systolic arterial pressure should be kept close to RV systolic pressure to maintain RV perfusion. When these efforts fail, the judicious use of inotropic agents may help improve RV contractility enough to maintain cardiac output. Extracorporeal life support is increasingly being used to support patients with acute RV failure who fail to respond to medical management while the underlying cause of their RV failure is addressed.

Despite recent advances in the management of these patients, sudden death accounts for up to 50{\%} of this mortality, and effective treatment strategies have yet to be identified. Preliminary trials with amiodarone have offered promise that drugs that prolong action potential duration by blocking the potassium channel may be useful in reducing this mortality.

abstract = {Aims: Three randomized trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy vs medical treatment for the prevention of death in survivors of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia have been reported with what might appear to be different results. The present analysis was performed to obtain the most precise estimate of the efficacy of the ICD, compared to amiodarone, for prolonging survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Methods and Results: Individual patient data from the Antiarrhythmics vs Implantable Defibrillator (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH) and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) were merged into a master database according to a pre-specified protocol. Proportional hazard modelling of individual patient data was used to estimate hazard ratios and to investigate subgroup interactions. Fixed effect meta-analysis techniques were also used to evaluate treatment effects and to assess heterogeneity across studies. The classic fixed effects meta-analysis showed that the estimates of ICD benefit from the three studies were consistent with each other (P heterogeneity=0.306). It also showed a significant reduction in death from any cause with the ICD; with a summary hazard ratio (ICD:amiodarone) of 0.72 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.60, 0.87; P=0.0006). For the outcome of arrhythmic death, the hazard ratio was 0.50 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.37, 0.67; P{\textless}0.0001). Survival was extended by a mean of 4.4 months by the ICD over a follow-up period of 6 years. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥35{\%} derived significantly more benefit from ICD therapy than those with better preserved left ventricular function. Patients treated before the availability of non-thoracotomy ICD implants derived significantly less benefit from ICD therapy than those treated in the non-thoracotomy era. Conclusion: Results from the three trials of the ICD vs amiodarone are consistent with each other. There is a 28{\%} reduction in the relative risk of death with the ICD that is due almost entirely to a 50{\%} reduction in arrhythmic death. (C) 2000 The European Society of Cardiology.},

Evidence suggests that this therapy is useful in the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death among patients who have survived arrhythmic events. Several trials have also shown the usefulness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Other data support the use of this device for various infiltrative and inherited conditions. When used with cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have improved survival rates and quality of life in patients with severe heart failure.

abstract = {Background: Differentiation between ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction over an accessory AV pathway (AP) and the AV node (AVN) may be difficult, especially in patients with a septal AP. Methods and Results: A new pacing method, para-Hisian pacing, was tested in 149 patients with AP and 53 patients without AP who had AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Ventricular pacing was performed adjacent to the His bundle and proximal right bundle branch (HB-RB), initially at high output to capture both RV and HB-RB. The output was then decreased to lose HB-RB capture. The change in timing and sequence of retrograde atrial activation between HB-RB capture and noncapture was examined. Loss of HB-RB capture without change in stimulus- atrial (S-A) interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AP conduction. An increase in S-A interval without change in His bundle-atrial interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AVN conduction. A change in atrial activation sequence indicated the presence of both retrograde AP and AVN conduction. Para-Hisian pacing correctly identified retrograde AP conduction in 132 of 147 AP patients, including all septal and right free wall APs. Retrograde AVN conduction masked AP conduction in 9 of 34 patients with a left free wall AP and 6 of 9 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Para-Hisian pacing correctly excluded AP conduction in all 53 patients with AVNRT. Conclusions: Para-Hisian pacing reliably identifies retrograde conduction over septal and right free wall APs, but AVN conduction may mask APs located far from the pacing site or with a long retrograde conduction time.},

We assessed the maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil in plasma (primary endpoint) and changes in cardiac function and ventricular diameters. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786512. Findings From March 17, 2014, to March 5, 2015, we enrolled 150 patients in the fixed-dose omecamtiv mecarbil group and 149 in the pharmacokinetic-titration and placebo groups. Mean maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil at 12 weeks was 200 (SD 71) ng/mL in the fixed-dose group and 318 (129) ng/mL in the pharmacokinetic-titration group. For the pharmacokinetic-titration group versus placebo group at 20 weeks, least square mean differences were as follows: systolic ejection time 25 ms (95{\%} CI 18–32, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), stroke volume 3{\textperiodcentered}6 mL (0{\textperiodcentered}5–6{\textperiodcentered}7, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0217), left ventricular end-systolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}8 mm (−2{\textperiodcentered}9 to −0{\textperiodcentered}6, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0027), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}3 mm, (−2{\textperiodcentered}3 to 0{\textperiodcentered}3, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0128), heart rate −3{\textperiodcentered}0 beats per min (−5{\textperiodcentered}1 to −0{\textperiodcentered}8, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0070), and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide concentration in plasma −970 pg/mL (−1672 to −268, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0069). The frequency of adverse clinical events did not differ between groups. Interpretation Omecamtiv mecarbil dosing guided by pharmacokinetics achieved plasma concentrations associated with improved cardiac function and decreased ventricular diameter. Funding Amgen.},

abstract = {Spatial dispersion of repolarization in the form of transmural, trans-septal and apico-basal dispersion of repolarization creates voltage gradients that inscribe the J wave and T wave of the EGG. Amplification of this spatial dispersion of repolarization (SDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited or acquired ion channelopathies giving rise to the long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS). This review focuses on the role of spatial dispersion of repolarization in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis associated with the long QT and BrS. In the long QT syndrome, drug-induced amplification of SDR is often secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) of M cells, whereas in the BrS, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the APD of right ventricular epicardium. Among the challenges ahead is the identification of a means to quantitate SDR non-invasively. This review also discusses the value of the interval between the peak and end of the T wave (Tpeak-Tend, Tp-Te) as an index of SDR and transmural dispersion of repolarization, in particular.

abstract = {Introduction: In patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) but preserved left ventricular (LV) function, sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) may arise in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is unknown whether an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is mandatory in these patients as VA might be triggered by a reversible cause. The purpose of this study is to analyze the benefit of ICD therapy in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in ICD recipients implanted from 2008 to 2011. The study group consisted of patients with sustained VA in the setting of an ACS, with a history of MI, but with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35 (group A). The two control groups consisted of patients admitted with VA with a history of MI, but without ACS at presentation, either with LVEF greater than 35{\%} (group B) or ≤35{\%} (group C). The primary endpoint was the number of patients with appropriate ICD therapy (antitachycardia pacing or shock). Results: A total of 291 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 45.6{\%} of the patients in group A vs 51.6{\%} and 60.4{\%} in groups B and C (P =.11). In group A, 31.1{\%} received an appropriate ICD shock vs 34.7{\%} and 44.3{\%} in control groups B and C (P =.12). Conclusion: On the basis of these data, ICD implantation seems warranted in patients with history of MI presenting with VA in the setting of an ACS, despite preserved LV function and adequate revascularization. Further trials, preferably randomizes, should be performed to address these findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), except in those with completely reversible causes. We sought to examine the impact of ICD therapy on mortality in survivors of SCA associated with reversible causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the records of 1433 patients managed at our institution between 2000 and 2012 who were discharged alive after SCA. A reversible and correctable cause was identified in 792 (55{\%}) patients. Reversible SCA cause was defined as significant electrolyte or metabolic abnormality, evidence of acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, recent initiation of antiarrhythmic drug or illicit drug use, or other reversible circumstances. Of the 792 SCA survivors because of a reversible and correctable cause (age 61±15 years, 40{\%} women), 207 (26{\%}) patients received an ICD after their index SCA. During a mean follow-up of 3.8±3.1 years, 319 (40{\%}) patients died. ICD implantation was highly associated with lower all-cause mortality (P{\textless}0.001) even after correcting for unbalanced baseline characteristics (P{\textless}0.001). In subgroup analyses, only patients whose SCA was not associated with myocardial infarction extracted benefit from ICD (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of SCA because of a reversible and correctable cause, ICD therapy is associated with lower all-cause mortality except if the SCA was because of myocardial infarction. These data deserve further investigation in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial, as they may have important and immediate clinical implications.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in patients with congestive heart failure and commonly results in clinical deterioration and hospitalization. Sinus rhythm may be maintained with antiarrhythmic drugs, but some of these drugs increase the risk of death. Methods: We studied 1518 patients-with symptomatic congestive heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 34 Danish hospitals. We randomly assigned 762 patients to receive dofetilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, and 756 to receive placebo in a double-blind study. Treatment was initiated in the hospital and included three days of cardiac monitoring and dose adjustment. The primary end point was death from any cause. Results: During a median follow-up of 18 months, 311 patients in the dofetilide group (41 percent) and 317 patients in the placebo group (42 percent) died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.11). Treatment with dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure (risk ratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.89). Dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. After one month, 22 of 190 patients with atrial fibrillation at base line (12 percent) had sinus rhythm restored with dofetilide, as compared with only 3 of 201 patients (1 percent) given placebo. Once sinus rhythm was restored, dofetilide was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm (hazard ratio for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001). There were 25 cases of torsade de pointes in the dofetilide group (3.3 percent) as corn pared with none in the placebo group. Conclusions: In patients with congestive heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation, preventing its recurrence, and reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Dofetilide had no effect on mortality.},

abstract = {Aims: Electrical cardioversion is commonly performed to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is unsuccessful in 10-12{\%} of attempts. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel cardioversion protocol for this arrhythmia. Methods and results: Consecutive elective cardioversion attempts for AF between October 2012 and July 2017 at a tertiary cardiovascular centre before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) implementing the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol (OAFCP) as an institutional initiative in July 2015 were evaluated. The primary outcome was cardioversion success, defined as ≥2 consecutive sinus beats or atrial-paced beats in patients with implanted cardiac devices. Secondary outcomes were first shock success, sustained success (sinus or atrial-paced rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to discharge from hospital), and procedural complications. Cardioversion was successful in 459/500 (91.8{\%}) in Phase I compared with 386/389 (99.2{\%}) in Phase II (P {\textless} 0.001). This improvement persisted after adjusting for age, body mass index, amiodarone use, and transthoracic impedance using modified Poisson regression [adjusted relative risk 1.08, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11; P {\textless} 0.001] and when analysed as an interrupted time series (change in level +9.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI 6.8-12.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). The OAFCP was also associated with greater first shock success (88.4{\%} vs. 79.2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and sustained success (91.6{\%} vs 84.7{\%}; P=0.002). No serious complications occurred. Conclusion: Implementing the OAFCP was associated with a 7.4{\%} absolute increase in cardioversion success and increases in first shock and sustained success without serious procedural complications. Its use could safely improve cardioversion success in patients with AF. Clinical trial number: www.clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02192957.},

abstract = {Reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and recovery of LV function are associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A growing body of evidence suggests that even among patients who experience a complete normalization of LV ejection fraction, a significant proportion will develop recurrent LV dysfunction accompanied by recurrent heart failure events. This has led to intense interest in understanding how to manage patients with heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecEF). Because of the lack of a standard definition for HFrecEF, and the paucity of clinical data with respect to the natural history of HFrecEF patients, there are no current guidelines on how these patients should be followed up and managed. Accordingly, this JACC Scientific Expert Panel reviews the biology of reverse LV remodeling and the clinical course of patients with HFrecEF, as well as provides guidelines for defining, diagnosing, and managing patients with HFrecEF.},

We studied, whether prophylactic therapy with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, as compared with conventional medical therapy, would improve survival in this high-risk group of patients. Methods: Over the course of five years, 196 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I, II, or III with prior myocardial infarction; a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.35; a documented episode of asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia; and inducible, nonsuppressible ventricular tachyarrhythmia on electrophysiologic study were randomly assigned to receive an implanted defibrillator (n=95) or conventional medical therapy (n= 101). We used a two-sided sequential design with death from any cause as the end point. Results: The base-line characteristics of the two treatment groups were similar. During an average follow-up of 27 months, there were 15 deaths in the defibrillator group (11 from cardiac causes) and 39 deaths in the conventional-therapy group (27 from cardiac causes) (hazard ratio for overall mortality, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.82; P=0.009). There was no evidence that amiodarone, beta-blockers, or any other antiarrhythmic therapy had a significant influence on the observed hazard ratio.

abstract = {Importance: Catheter ablation is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effects on long-term mortality and stroke risk are uncertain. Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2{\%} female; 42.9{\%} had paroxysmal AF and 57.1{\%} had persistent AF), 89.3{\%} completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8{\%}) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5{\%}) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0{\%} (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2{\%} (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95{\%} CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2{\%} vs 6.1{\%} for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95{\%} CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7{\%} vs 58.1{\%} for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95{\%} CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9{\%} vs 69.5{\%} for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},

abstract = {Background In survivors of sudden cardiac arrest with obstructive coronary artery disease, it remains challenging to distinguish ischemia as a reversible cause from irreversible scar-related ventricular arrhythmias. We aimed to evaluate the value of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in sudden cardiac arrest survivors with presumably reversible ischemia and complete revascularization. Methods and Results This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 276 patients (80{\%} men, age 67±10 years) receiving ICD implantation for secondary prevention. Angiography was performed before ICD implantation. A subgroup of 166 (60{\%}) patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement before implantation. Patients were divided in 2 groups, (1) ICD-per-guideline, including 228 patients with incomplete revascularization or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35{\%}, and (2) ICD-off-label, including 48 patients with complete revascularization and left ventricular ejection fraction {\textgreater}35{\%}. The primary outcome was time to appropriate device therapy (ADT). During 4.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5-4.6) of follow-up, ADT developed in 15{\%} of the ICD-off-label group versus 43{\%} of the ICD-per-guideline group. Time to ADT was comparable in the ICD-off-label and ICD-per-guideline groups (hazard ratio (HR), 0.46; P=0.08). No difference in mortality was observed (HR, 0.95; P=0.93). Independent predictors of ADT included age (HR, 1.03; P=0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume HR, (1.05 per 10 mL increase; P{\textless}0.01) and extent of transmural late gadolinium enhancement (HR, 1.12; P=0.04). Conclusions This study demonstrates that sudden cardiac arrest survivors with coronary artery disease remain at high risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, even after complete revascularization and with preserved left ventricular function. Late gadolinium enhancement-cardiac magnetic resonance imaging derived left ventricular volumes and extent of myocardial scar were independently associated with.},

abstract = {Background There are two approaches to the treat- ment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both ap- proaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recom- mended. Methods We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in pa- tients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results A total of 4060 patients (mean [±SD] age, 69.7±9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 per- cent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normal- ized ratio was subtherapeutic. Conclusions Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advan- tage over the rate-control strategy, and there are po- tential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoag- ulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients. (N},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use. METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. RESULTS: In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236±1440 and 4373±1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05±0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4±26.5 ?mol per liter] and 0.07±0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430±1401 vs. 4171±1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08±0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04±0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Among patients with heart failure who have mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dysfunction, the prognosis is poor. Transcatheter mitral-valve repair may improve their clinical outcomes. METHODS At 78 sites in the United States and Canada, we enrolled patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy (device group) or medical therapy alone (control group). The primary effectiveness end point was all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months of follow-up. The primary safety end point was freedom from device-related complications at 12 months; the rate for this end point was compared with a prespecified objective performance goal of 88.0{\%}. RESULTS Of the 614 patients who were enrolled in the trial, 302 were assigned to the device group and 312 to the control group. The annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months was 35.8{\%} per patient-year in the device group as compared with 67.9{\%} per patient-year in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.70; P{\textless}0.001). The rate of freedom from device-related complications at 12 months was 96.6{\%} (lower 95{\%} confidence limit, 94.8{\%}; P{\textless}0.001 for comparison with the performance goal). Death from any cause within 24 months occurred in 29.1{\%} of the patients in the device group as compared with 46.1{\%} in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, transcatheter mitral-valve repair resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure and lower all-cause mortality within 24 months of follow-up than medical therapy alone. The rate of freedom from device-related complications exceeded a prespecified safety threshold. (Funded by Abbott; COAPT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01626079 .).},

abstract = {Background-The Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Study compared treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators versus antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). AVID maintained a Registry on all patients, randomized or not, with any VA or unexplained syncope who could be considered for either of the treatment strategies. Trial-eligible arrhythmias were the categories of VF cardiac arrest; Syncopal VT, and Symptomatic VT, below. Methods and Results-Of 5989 patients screened, 4595 were registered and 1016 were randomized. Mortality follow-up through 1996 was obtained on the 4219 Registry patients enrolled before 1997 through the National Death Index. Crude mortality rates (mean±SD, follow-up, 16.9±11.5 months) were: VF cardiac arrest, 17.0{\%} (n=1399, 238 deaths); Syncopal VT, 21.2{\%} (n=598, 127 deaths); Symptomatic VT, 15.8{\%} (n= 1065, 168 deaths); Stable (asymptomatic) VT, 19.7{\%} (n=497, 98 deaths); VT/VF with transient/correctable cause, 17.8{\%} (n=270, 48 deaths); and Unexplained syncope, 12.3{\%} (n=390, 48 deaths). Conclusions-Patients with seemingly lower-risk or unknown-risk VAs (asymptomatic VT, and VT/VF associated with a transient factor) have a (high) mortality similar to that of higher-risk, AVID-eligible VAs. The similar (and poor) prognosis of most patients with VT/VF suggests the need for reevaluation of a priori risk grouping and raises the question of the appropriate arrhythmia therapy for a broad range of patients.},

abstract = {Aims: Three randomized trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy vs medical treatment for the prevention of death in survivors of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia have been reported with what might appear to be different results. The present analysis was performed to obtain the most precise estimate of the efficacy of the ICD, compared to amiodarone, for prolonging survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Methods and Results: Individual patient data from the Antiarrhythmics vs Implantable Defibrillator (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH) and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) were merged into a master database according to a pre-specified protocol. Proportional hazard modelling of individual patient data was used to estimate hazard ratios and to investigate subgroup interactions. Fixed effect meta-analysis techniques were also used to evaluate treatment effects and to assess heterogeneity across studies. The classic fixed effects meta-analysis showed that the estimates of ICD benefit from the three studies were consistent with each other (P heterogeneity=0.306). It also showed a significant reduction in death from any cause with the ICD; with a summary hazard ratio (ICD:amiodarone) of 0.72 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.60, 0.87; P=0.0006). For the outcome of arrhythmic death, the hazard ratio was 0.50 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.37, 0.67; P{\textless}0.0001). Survival was extended by a mean of 4.4 months by the ICD over a follow-up period of 6 years. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥35{\%} derived significantly more benefit from ICD therapy than those with better preserved left ventricular function. Patients treated before the availability of non-thoracotomy ICD implants derived significantly less benefit from ICD therapy than those treated in the non-thoracotomy era. Conclusion: Results from the three trials of the ICD vs amiodarone are consistent with each other. There is a 28{\%} reduction in the relative risk of death with the ICD that is due almost entirely to a 50{\%} reduction in arrhythmic death. (C) 2000 The European Society of Cardiology.},
