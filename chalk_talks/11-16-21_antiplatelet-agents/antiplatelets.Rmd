### Atherosclerosis

- Leads to narrowing of the arterial lumen, allowing for tissue ischemia to occur with increased metabolic demands (e.g. coronary ischemia with angina)

- Increases risk for plaque rupture or erosion $\rightarrow$ intravascular thrombi

- Arterial thrombi are _white clots_ which are primarily platelets, stabilized by fibrin and tissue factor (that triggers coagulation cascade)

- Both platelet activation and coagulation cascade occur in parallel

### Pharmacology 

There are three general, non-redundant pathways for platelet activation. 

1. $TXA_{2}$ (thromboxane) pathway

1. $ADP$ (adenosine diphosphate) pathway

1. Thrombin-activated pathways

All transduce __independent__ signals for platelet activation, and are thus __additive__.

---
### Pathways

| Pathway | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors | $COX1$ suppresses $TXA_{2}$ |
| $P2Y_{12}$ inhibitors | $ADP$ receptor blockade |
| Protease-activated receptor inhibitors | $PAR1$ and $PAR4$ ligand blockade (normally activated by thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis) |

---
### Agents

| Mechanism | Subtypes | Drugs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $COX$ inhibitors | type 1 | aspirin | 
| $COX$ inhibitors | type 2 | NSAIDs | 
| $P_{2}Y_{12}$ receptor blockers | irreversible | ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel |
| $P_{2}Y_{12}$ receptor blockers | reversible | ticagrelor, cangrelor |
| $GPII_{a}III_{b}$ inhibitors | monoclonal Ab | abciximab |
| $GPII_{a}III_{b}$ inhibitors | synthetic | eptifibatide, tirofiban |
| $PDE$ inhibitors | | dipyridamole, cilostazol | 
| $PAR$ inhibitors | type 1 | vorapaxar |

### Secondary Prevention

.pull-left[
#### Stable Coronary Artery Disease

With no intervention: 

- SAPT with low-dose aspirin
- SAPT with clopidogrel as an _alternative_ 

With PCI (DES):

- DAPT for 6 months

]

.pull-right[
#### Acute Coronary Syndrome

With PCI (DES):

- DAPT for 12 months (and then SAPT)
- Can decrease to 6 months based on bleeding risk

_However, data is increasing for reducing the duration of DAPT._

]

Even with antiplatelet therapy, __2-5%__ of CAD/PAD patients have __MACE__.

---
### Dual Antiplatelet Therapy

| Combination | Indication |
|:--- |:--- |
| aspirin $+$ clopidogrel | elective PCI for stable CAD (due to slower onset of action) |
| aspirin $+$ prasugrel | ACS with planned PCI (higher rate of CABG-related bleeding), no need to preload, contraindicated in CVA, no shown benefit in age $\gt$ 75 years |
| aspirin $+$ ticagrelor | ACS with either PCI or CABG, contraindicated in ICH, 10% side effect of dyspnea |
| aspirin $+$ vorapaxar | unclear benefit, potentially helpful in stable PAD |
| aspirin $+$ dipyridamole | non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke/TIA |
