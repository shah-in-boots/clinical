ASSESSMENT and PLAN
 
Antoinette Archer is a 70 y.o. female h/o ESRD on HD< PAD, dementia, FTT/PCM s/p PEG, OM s/p right hallux amputation, chornic anemia, p/w AMS and potential OM/sepsis.
 
#. Acute on chronic encephalopathy
#. Vascular dementia
#. FTT c/b severe PCM
Likely multifactorial, acute worsening related to toxic metabolic from sepsis as below with superimposed delirium but with underlying vascular dementia and slow decline over last several months.  CT with severe chronic microvascular changes but no acute abnormality.
HIV-, TSH nl, RPR negative
-Continue thiamine repletion via PEG
-S/p treatment of sepsis as below
-Overall prognosis is very poor, appreciate palliative care consult.  Multiple family meetings and ongoing GOC discussions, family agreeable to hospice referrals for information only - still making final decision re stopping HD
- Palliative signed off 11/1, appreciate consult
- Awaiting SNF placement
 
#. Osteomyelits c- sepsis
Recently amputated toe is most likely source. Xrays with "First transmetatarsal amputation with marked soft tissue gas and swelling in the first digit stump associated with osseous irregularity along the surgical margin concerning for osteomyelitis." ESR 114. crp 21. WBC count 20.9. Blood cx no growth.  New low-grade fevers despite broad spectrum abx, no clear etiology as covered pretty broadly with vanc/zosyn and no localizing signs/sx.
-repeat blood cultures 10/11= neg and CXR 10/11= unremarkable
-Holding off on additional imaging with MRI non-contrast to evaluate for osteo given this would be unlikely to change management and would be v difficult to position patient given contractures
-Consulted ID, appreciate assistance
-s/p vanc/zosyn (9/28-10/14) (avoid cefe as can cause encephalopathy).  Patient completed over 6 weeks of IV abx, no indications to continue for osteo at this time
- Vascular surgery consulted on admission.  No plans for any surgical therapy at any time unless she develops a life-threatening soft tissue infection and her family would like to pursue above-knee amputation.
- GOC discussions as above
- Wound care consulted, appreciate assistance
 
#. ESRD c- HD TTS
- Appreciate renal consult, patient not tolerating much fluid removal due to hypotension. - continue HD per schedule if tolerating.  Continue GOC discussion
- Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxic meds
 
#. Anemia of chronic/renal dz c/b GIB
- Suspect multifactorial due to ACD and ESRD with recent GIB. Episode of rectal bleeding witnessed 10/3 and 10/7, CT bleeding protocol negative.  +hemorrhoids on exam.  Suspect BRBPR related to hemorrhoids, Hgb stable and pt is poor candidate for EGD/colonoscopy given overall clinical status and prognosis.
-S/p 1 unit 9/29 and 10/10 with appropriate response
-Monitor Hgb and transfuse as needed for Hgb<7
-Hold asa

Sharon Y Parks is a 60 y.o. female h/o smoking, HFpEF, severe emphysema c/b rupture bleb, c/b BPF, c/b collapsed left lung, h/o treated pulmonary TB (2011), h/o aspergillosis (2018), and recurrent hemoptysis while on AC (DC in July 2019, unknown indication). She presents c- persistent hemoptysis, small volume.
 
#. Hemoptysis d/t underlying bronchiectasis c- erosions into pulmonary vessels
#. COPD/emphysema (IV/D) c/b blebs, c/b BPF, requiring home O2
#. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
- Pt w/ complicated pulmonary issues - smoker, with Stage IV COPD, severe emphysema c/b ruptured bleb in the past and bronchopleural fistula p/f hemoptysis. Pt is not surgical candidate per outpatient pulm. CT chest this admission hows emphysematous bullous changes, bronchopleural fistula, partial collapse of left lung. No PTX appreciated per pulm. Etiology of bleed thought to be due to patient's extensive left-sided bronchiectasis with erosion into pulmonary blood vessels, which is likely going to be a chronic problem. No need for bronch given clinical stability and likely left-sided source. 
--trend CBC, INR, T&S q72h
--IR embolization planned for Monday (NPO at MN)
--Pt noted to have increased bleeding after dc of TXA - so TXA resumed 11/1/19

#. Pulmonary Aspergillus detected in BAL in 2017, on life long vorioconazole 
#. H/o TB treated and last AFB 11/2018 was normal. No night sweats, or fever. Would continue to monitor. Last AFB was negative

- tolerating BB
- will see if after fever curve resolves and potential infection, may not need BB

#. Zinc deficiency c- dermatitis
#. Scabies infestation c/b potential superinfection e.g. Impetigo
- conitnue folate, thiamine

#. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
- Her sx are semi-acute, ~1 week, and most likely represent a simple PNA, perhaps atypical s- obvious findings on CXR
- however, in setting of uncontrolled HIV, off of ARV and dapsone, would strongly consider both TB and PCP
- starting a three-pronged approach in her mgmt: 1) dx and tx for PCP c- TMP-SMX, ABG pending for severity, and respiratory/sputum cx to be stained, 2) rule out TB c- AFB smears/sputum induction, 3) atypical PNA based on imaging findings + hyponatremia, will start on levofloxacin
- f/u on blood and sputum cx
 
#. Hyponatremia
- monitor c- IVF, likely sx of above syndrome
 
#. HIV/AIDS (CD4 12/2%/VL = log5) s- ARV/dapsone
- continue her home meds, will hold dapsone for now
