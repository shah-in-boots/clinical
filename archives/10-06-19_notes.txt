P/w presyncope from rehab, found to have elevated lactate, tachycardia, and hypotension c/w sepsis of unknown etiology.

#. Pre-syncopal episode
- initial ddx included biliary drain, tunneled cath, recent PICC
- CT a/p and exam not c/w intraabdominal source, and LA improved c- IVF

- likely d/t nausea, on antiemetic regimen
- aggressive BR

#. Cholecystitis s/p PCT, c/b ileus

- aggressive BR increased to four agents

#. Persistent tachycardia 
- home metoprolol

#. AKI d/t ischemic ATN
- worsened d/t relative hypotension, last HD 9/27, tunneled HD catheter placed during prior hospitalization
- nephrology cs appreciated, will check lytes regularly
- suspect prolonged renal recovery, creatinine improved to 4.0 from 4.5 today
 
#. Transaminitis 
- hepatitis negative, CT wnl, monitoring

#. Provoked DVT of LLE, h/o unprovoked PE s/p IVC filter (2015), h/o PFO
