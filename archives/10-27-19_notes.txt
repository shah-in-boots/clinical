ASSESSMENT and PLAN

Antoinette Archer is a 70 y.o. female h/o ESRD on HD< PAD, dementia, FTT/PCM s/p PEG, OM s/p right hallux amputation, chornic anemia, p/w AMS and potential OM/sepsis.

#. Acute on chronic encephalopathy
#. Vascular dementia
#. FTT c/b severe PCM
Likely multifactorial, acute worsening related to toxic metabolic from sepsis as below with superimposed delirium but with underlying vascular dementia and slow decline over last several months.  CT with severe chronic microvascular changes but no acute abnormality.
HIV-, TSH nl, RPR negative
-Continue thiamine repletion via PEG
-S/p treatment of sepsis as below
-Overall prognosis is very poor, appreciate palliative care consult.  Multiple family meetings and ongoing GOC discussions, family agreeable to hospice referrals for information only - still making final decision re stopping HD
-Appreciate palliative care c/s, f/u recs
-Per recent note (10/16), daughters waiting for more family to come from East Coast, only hospice facilities have reached out with options. 
-Updated SW/NCM regarding recent Palliative care, appreciate continued coordination efforts
- If pt with another fever, will initiate a sepsis w/u given she has a Permacath 
 
#. Osteomyelits c- sepsis
Recently amputated toe is most likely source. Xrays with "First transmetatarsal amputation with marked soft tissue gas and swelling in the first digit stump associated with osseous irregularity along the surgical margin concerning for osteomyelitis." ESR 114. crp 21. WBC count 20.9. Blood cx no growth.  New low-grade fevers despite broad spectrum abx, no clear etiology as covered pretty broadly with vanc/zosyn and no localizing signs/sx.
-repeat blood cultures 10/11= neg and CXR 10/11= unremarkable
-Holding off on additional imaging with MRI non-contrast to evaluate for osteo given this would be unlikely to change management and would be v difficult to position patient given contractures
-Consulted ID, appreciate assistance
-s/p vanc/zosyn (9/28-10/14) (avoid cefe as can cause encephalopathy).  Patient completed over 6 weeks of IV abx, no indications to continue at this time
- Vascular surgery consulted on admission.  No plans for any surgical therapy at any time unless she develops a life-threatening soft tissue infection and her family would like to pursue above-knee amputation.
- GOC discussions as above
- Wound care consulted, appreciate assistance
- Monitoring off abx

#. ESRD c- HD TTS.
Appreciate renal consult, patient not tolerating much fluid removal due to hypotension. - continue HD per schedule if tolerating.  Continue GOC discussion
- Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxic meds
 
#. Anemia
Suspect multifactorial due to ACD and ESRD with recent GIB. Episode of rectal bleeding witnessed 10/3 and 10/7, CT bleeding protocol negative.  +hemorrhoids on exam.  Suspect BRBPR related to hemorrhoids, Hgb stable and pt is poor candidate for EGD/colonoscopy given overall clinical status and prognosis.
-S/p 1 unit 9/29 and 10/10 with appropriate response
-Monitor Hgb and transfuse as needed for Hgb<7
-Hold asa 
- Decrease PPI to qday
 
#. T2DM
- continue, q 6 accucheck, SSI d/c'd due to pt episodes of hypoglycemia

#. Back pain
- attempt lidocaine patch

Outpatient PCP: Hoos, Ann E., MD
 
Principal and Secondary Diagnoses:
#. AKI/CKD
#. HTN urgency
#. Uterine mass
 
Diagnostic Tests:
 
Renal US: Bilateral kidneys are moderately atrophic with increased echogenicity suggestive of chronic medical renal disease. No hydronephrosis.
 
Transvaginal US: Large exophytic fundal solid mass, likely a pedunculated fibroid, however would strongly recommend nonemergent pelvic MRI to confirm. Comparison to any outside studies would be helpful.
 
Brief Presenting History:
 
VERONICA GALLEGOS CONTRERAS is a 43 y.o. female h|o HTN and hx of proteinuria presents after referral from PCP office with labs showing elevated Cr at 5and proteinuria. Patient was seen by her PCP on 10/21 and was noted to be hypertensive to > 200s. She was completely asymptomatic - started on lisinopril 5, HCTZ 12.5, amlodipine 5. 
 
She denies any headache, chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, blood in urine, dysuria.She reports occasional headaches with associated nausea around the time of her menstrual periods which she attributes to Migraine. 
 
In 2005, patient had proteinuria and hypertension after pregnancy for which she had a renl biopsy.
 
Hospital Course by Problem List:
 
#. AKI on CKD V
- p/w Cr of 5.6 with slight downtrend (5.1 at time of DC)
- renal cs, believes likely CKD based on renal US (small kidneys) and chronic HTN
- secondary w/u ordered and pending (including AI and viral)
- DC on bicarb, PO4 binder, and antihypertensives
 
#. HTN urgency
- initial BP > 200
- improved c- PO agents
- DC on amlodipine and hydralazine
 
#. Uterine mass
- Likely fibroid, but MRI pelvis ordered
- Can pursue as OP
 
The remainder of the patient's medical problems were chronic and stable without any further intervention this admission. The patient will continue the current treatments and medications.

ASSESSMENT and PLAN
 
TVANTE V FRANKLIN is a 26 y.o. male with a history of gunshot wound, c/b paraplegia, chronic sacral/hip ulcers, osteomyelitis, neurogenic bladder with chronic indwelling foley catheter and seizure disorder who presents with extreme pain from decubitus ulcers, complaint of increased/foul smelling drainage; afebrile, no leukocytosis, low concern for acute on chronic osteomyelitis, admitted for wound care, pain control.
 
#. Chronic Pain 2/2 Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcers and prior L femur surgery/Paraplegia
#. Chronic Indwelling foley
#. Ostomy
Chronic pain in his back and legs from sacral decubitus ulcers and left femur surgery, respectively. 
--Chronic pain continues to limit our progress.
--Has good reason to have pain and has been more cooperative so will try to facilitate daily discussion with him
--Does not follow up with PCP and has been getting narcotics from various sources for years 
--Valium 5 mg qhs 
- 1200mg gabapentin 3 times daily
--Will limit IV pain medications
- Plastics and ortho recommend good wound care to encourage healing and will see him in clinic to evaluate for other surgical options including a FLAP.  Ortho will not intervene unless he gets a flap.  Needs referral for plastics on discharge 
 
#. Depression/Mood Disorder
--Appreciate psych input
--Valium at night for sleep and muscle spams
--Very labile mood, not overtly having SI/HI
 
#. Chronic osteomyelitis, Stage III sacral and hip decubitus ulcers, venous stasis ulcer right ankle
Low suspicion for acute on chronic Osteo, CRP 10.73, lower than prior hospitalization. Per plastic surgery in prior admission, patient's ulcers are too advanced, and his nutritional status is too poor to benefit from a surgical flap. 
--Plan for daily wound care in order and offloading at SNF to enable wound healing with the hopes of being a candidate for a FLAP with plastics surgery
--Mr. Franklin is very motivated by his 8 year old daughter to get better
--Agreed to go to SNF if SNF acceptable (Referrals will be sent). If no accepting facility then will go home with home health.
--Transportation has been an issue for follow ups but he states his GF has a car and will not be an issue going forward
- Bilateral MRI's ordered initally but I cancelled the order given unlikely to change clinical course
- Wound bases clean, no necrotic tissue or purulent drainage
- Ordered wound care/PT wound care, appreciate help

ASSESSMENT and PLAN

Cheryl Meadows is a 48 y.o. female CAD, IDDM, recent unprovoked PE that p/w pleuritic chest pain.

#. Musculoskeletal chest pain d/t persistent coughing
This is not cardiac nor pulmonary in nature of pain, but likely from repeated coughing. THere could be an underlying PNA from an area of liquefaction or necrosis after pulmonary infarct (quite possible in her setting of PE), c- GGO on CT. Or could be a viral illness as well, however has been oxygenating quite well. I think the most likely scenario is sometype of viral URI/LRI that lead to a coughing, that then lead to fatigue/weakness, and tussive MSK pain. SHe seems to be improving on APAP, and will give her more time c- topic agents for now. Since she is on a DOAC currently, am trying to avoid NSAIDs. Has tried topical voltaren to no avail. She continues to eat and drink well.
