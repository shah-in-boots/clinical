- currently stable, c- improving pain
- daily packing changes
- switched from IV vanc to PO clinda, tolerating well

#. AKI, potentially d/t vancomycin vs prerenal
- IVF and reassessed, however Cr ~1.7, b/l 1.0
- monitoring x 1 more day, will ask for OP f/u

#. Acute lacunar infarct c/b right hand weakness
- neurology f/u, recommend further risk reduction
- MRA brain c/w lacunar etiology, TTE WNL
- ASA/statin, and BP goals

#. DMT2, on home metformin and glipizide
- scheduled insulin 4U + SSI while inpatient
- hold off on metforming as OP until Cr stabilizes

- cardiology recommends tx, will start c- colchicine low dose daily and look for improvement
