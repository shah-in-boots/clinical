ASSESSMENT and PLAN

#. Inability to walk requiring need for placement
- Patient has presented multiple times to the ED with multiple admissions stating that she is unable to walk or take care of herself dating back at least 6 months. Per chart review, patient has been able to ambulate with a walker as of 9/2019, however through admission has been able to move legs
- PT/OT consulted - agrees w/ SNF though from prior notes it looks like patient gave minimal effort with PT
- Wanted to check TSH, vitamin B12, vitamin D, folate - refused labs
- Questionable decision-making capacity on admission, however pt has been, communicating a consistent choice,  understanding pertinent information (nature of illness), appreciating the circumstances & consequences (treatment options, prognosis with and without treatment, risk/ benefit ratio of treatment), &  ability to rationally manipulate the information. Using these above criteria, the patient does appear to be communicating a clear and consistent choice
- It is worth noting that this is a fluid measure and may change day to day, such that re-evaluation is required.
- Will avoid overly sedating medications or narcotics
- Dispo: Pending placement to SNF, DMA6 completed 10/22/2019. Patient is medically cleared for discharge, pending placement
- CMU emailed for consideration of transfer on 11/1
