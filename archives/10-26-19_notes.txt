ASSESSMENT and PLAN
 
Antoinette Archer is a 70 y.o. female h/o ESRD on HD< PAD, dementia, FTT/PCM s/p PEG, OM s/p right hallux amputation, chornic anemia, p/w AMS and potential OM/sepsis.
 
#. Acute on chronic encephalopathy
#. Vascular dementia
#. FTT c/b severe PCM
Likely multifactorial, acute worsening related to toxic metabolic from sepsis as below with superimposed delirium but with underlying vascular dementia and slow decline over last several months.  CT with severe chronic microvascular changes but no acute abnormality.
HIV-, TSH nl, RPR negative
-Continue thiamine repletion via PEG
-S/p treatment of sepsis as below
-Overall prognosis is very poor, appreciate palliative care consult.  Multiple family meetings and ongoing GOC discussions, family agreeable to hospice referrals for information only - still making final decision re stopping HD
-Appreciate palliative care c/s, f/u recs
-Per recent note (10/16), daughters waiting for more family to come from East Coast, only hospice facilities have reached out with options. 
-Updated SW/NCM regarding recent Palliative care, appreciate continued coordination efforts
- If pt with another fever, will initiate a sepsis w/u given she has a Permacath 
 
#. Osteomyelits c- sepsis
Recently amputated toe is most likely source. Xrays with "First transmetatarsal amputation with marked soft tissue gas and swelling in the first digit stump associated with osseous irregularity along the surgical margin concerning for osteomyelitis." ESR 114. crp 21. WBC count 20.9. Blood cx no growth.  New low-grade fevers despite broad spectrum abx, no clear etiology as covered pretty broadly with vanc/zosyn and no localizing signs/sx.
-repeat blood cultures 10/11= neg and CXR 10/11= unremarkable
-Holding off on additional imaging with MRI non-contrast to evaluate for osteo given this would be unlikely to change management and would be v difficult to position patient given contractures
-Consulted ID, appreciate assistance
-s/p vanc/zosyn (9/28-10/14) (avoid cefe as can cause encephalopathy).  Patient completed over 6 weeks of IV abx, no indications to continue at this time
- Vascular surgery consulted on admission.  No plans for any surgical therapy at any time unless she develops a life-threatening soft tissue infection and her family would like to pursue above-knee amputation.
- GOC discussions as above
- Wound care consulted, appreciate assistance
- Monitoring off abx
 
 
#. ESRD: on T/Th/S.
Appreciate renal consult, patient not tolerating much fluid removal due to hypotension. - continue HD per schedule if tolerating.  Continue GOC discussion
- Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxic meds
 
#. Anemia:  Suspect multifactorial due to ACD and ESRD with recent GIB. Episode of rectal bleeding witnessed 10/3 and 10/7, CT bleeding protocol negative.  +hemorrhoids on exam.  Suspect BRBPR related to hemorrhoids, Hgb stable and pt is poor candidate for EGD/colonoscopy given overall clinical status and prognosis.
-S/p 1 unit 9/29 and 10/10 with appropriate response
-Monitor Hgb and transfuse as needed for Hgb<7

- trop 0.24 -->_->0.28 on recheck; EKG w/o overt ischemic changes and pt denies active chest pain; does endorse weakness and transient dyspnea at home (now resolved); unclear etiology but ddx demand from ?hypovolemia (although not tachycardic, pt is on a BB) vs less likely NSTEMI. 
-- troponin peaked and downtrended, no need to repeat unless clinically indicated
-- continue ASA 81 mg daily
-- echo with no sign change, EF 60-65%
---Stress test with 5-10% reversible defect in the area of RCA.  Echo without wall motion abnormality

--Continue ASA and statin
--Restarted BB
 
#. Hypomag/Hypophos
Repleting. Tele monitoring. 
 
#. Metabolic Encephlopathy 2/2 to urinary retention/viral illness
Improved. Per family is not at baseline. No focal deficits. No signs of overt infection. Low suspicion for CSF infection given clinical stability.

--Geriatrics consult appreciated
--Seems like hypoactive delirium
 
#. Left Knee Effusion/OA/Pseudogout 
Chronic per family but significant effusion. Low suspicion for septic arthritis.
--Arthrocentesis performed and 40 cc of fluid removed
--Steroid injection into left knee
--Fluid analysis appears to be pseudogout 
--Uric acid normal
--ICE on knee
--PT/OT eval recommending SAR, family discussing
 
#Esophageal Thickening - likely due to chronic reflux, however malignancy not ruled out
- Continue PPI
- f/u GI as outpt for possible EGD eval
- Speech consult appreciated
 
#. Thrombocytopenia - likely d/t heavy, chronic etoh use
- monitor
 
# Alcohol abuse, chronic
.- 6x beers daily per pt; no hx or acute signs of withdrawal at this time
- cont monitoir for withdrawal

--High dose thiamine started

ASSESSMENT and PLAN

TVANTE V FRANKLIN is a 26 y.o. male with a history of gunshot wound, c/b paraplegia, chronic sacral/hip ulcers, osteomyelitis, neurogenic bladder with chronic indwelling foley catheter and seizure disorder who presents with extreme pain from decubitus ulcers, complaint of increased/foul smelling drainage; afebrile, no leukocytosis, low concern for acute on chronic osteomyelitis, admitted for wound care, pain control.
 
#Chronic Pain 2/2 Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcers and prior L femur surgery/Paraplegia
#Chronic INdwelling foley
#Ostomy
Chronic pain in his back and legs from sacral decubitus ulcers and left femur surgery, respectively. 
--Chronic pain continues to limit our progress.
--Has good reason to have pain and has been more cooperative so will try to facilitate daily discussion with him
--Does not follow up with PCP and has been getting narcotics from various sources for years 
--Valium 5 mg qhs 
- 900mg gabapentin 3 times daily
--Will limit IV pain medications
- Plastics and ortho recommend good wound care to encourage healing and will see him in clinic to evaluate for other surgical options including a FLAP.  Ortho will not intervene unless he gets a flap.  Needs referral for plastics on discharge 
 
#Depression/Mood Disorder
--Appreciate psych input
--Valium at night for sleep and muscle spams
--Very labile mood, not overtly having SI/HI
 
#. Chronic osteomyelitis, Stage III sacral and hip decubitus ulcers, venous stasis ulcer right ankle
Low suspicion for acute on chronic Osteo, CRP 10.73, lower than prior hospitalization. Per plastic surgery in prior admission, patient's ulcers are too advanced, and his nutritional status is too poor to benefit from a surgical flap. 
--Plan for daily wound care in order and offloading at SNF to enable wound healing with the hopes of being a candidate for a FLAP with plastics surgery
--Mr. Franklin is very motivated by his 8 year old daughter to get better
--Agreed to go to SNF if SNF acceptable (Referrals will be sent). If no accepting facility then will go home with home health.
--Transportation has been an issue for follow ups but he states his GF has a car and will not be an issue going forward
- Bilateral MRI's ordered initally but I cancelled the order given unlikely to change clinical course
- Wound bases clean, no necrotic tissue or purulent drainage
- Ordered wound care/PT wound care, appreciate help
 
#. Seizure Disorder
- 500mg levetiraceptam (keppra) BID

Chief Complaint: chest pain
 
History of present illness
Cheryl Meadows is a 48 y.o. female h/o recent bilateral segmental PE (unprovoked), CAD x 3V, morbid obesity p/w headache, cough, subjective fevers, and anterior and right sided chest pain. She has felt ill since being discharged in terms of rhinorrhea, headache, and occasional lightheadedness. She reports that today this included chest pain (sharp in the right and anterior part of her chest wall). She doesn't think its positional.

She remains compliant c- all of her medications, knows them by heart, and their dosing. She otherwise has been eating well, urinating well, and had no falls or trauma. 
 
Review of systems is negative for constitutional, endocrine, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurologic, dermatologic, urinary, musculoskeletal, hematologic symptoms except as reflected above.

Cheryl Meadows is a 48 y.o. female c- CAD, IDDM, recent unprovoked PE that p/w pleuritic chest pain.
 
ACUTE
 
#. Chest pain c/b elevated troponin, recent PE
This is not a clear dx. It is not responsive to NTG, but is better c- ASA. It is not reproducible or worse c- breathing, more right-sided in nature. She is able to sleep through the pain. Elevated Tn suggests some element of cardiac strain, but doesn't sound coronary in nature. The recent PE are a huge possibility, but the CT PE showed no advancement or change in imaging. 
- trend troponin
- sig DOAC for now
- consider hep gtt if trop remains elevated (stop DOAC)
- will trial APAP for now
- ddx include recurrent PE, pericarditis, pulmonary infarct (liquefaction and potential PNA)
