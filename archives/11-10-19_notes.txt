- Wanted to check TSH, vitamin B12, vitamin D, folate - refused labs
- Questionable decision-making capacity on admission, however pt has been, communicating a consistent choice,  understanding pertinent information (nature of illness), appreciating the circumstances & consequences (treatment options, prognosis with and without treatment, risk/ benefit ratio of treatment), &  ability to rationally manipulate the information. Using these above criteria, the patient does appear to be communicating a clear and consistent choice
- Will avoid overly sedating medications or narcotics

ASSESSMENT and PLAN

Terri Grier is a 61 y.o. female h/o CVA c- right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia, DM, GERD, HTN, and tobacco abuse p/w abdominal pain and vomiting. 

#. RLQ abdominal pain c- reported nausea/vomiting
#. Necrotic hepatic lesion c/f malignancy
- pt p/w this abd pain, but unable to report story d/t aphasia
- the pain is unclear in etiology, does not appear to be infectious (UA s- significant WBC, no diarrhea, no colitis or fat stranding or pericholic fluid on CT)
- the large liver lesion may well be malignancy, and may have been cause for abd discomfort in last several months
- would consider IP vs. OP w/u of liver lesion c- MRI per CT notes
- ddx remains as potential UTI (less likely), potential gastroparesis c- uncontrolled DM, or mass effect from liver lesion
- given antiemetics and PRN APAP, will monitor for improvement of pain
- no abx or other tx interventions yet

#. IDDM
- 25 long acting, 10 short acting prandial
- SSI/POCT

#. CVA c/b aphasia, hemiparesis
- ASA, statin
- did not order PT/OT, as pt has wheelchair and prior PT interventions (do not think she needs placement yet, just can't get in touch c- family. Chart seems to suggest a reliable care giver)

#. Chronic thrombocytopenia
- monitoring

#. Hypertension
- sig amlodipine, BB (didn't add ACEI yet as pt cannot confirm meds)

Procedure: Valsalva maneuver
Indication: SVT

Patient: Tanisha Grant
MRN: 100521792

Rapid response called for tachycardia to >200 with chest pain and palpitations. On evaluation, ECG showed SVT at ~210 rate. 18G IV was obtained in right AC. Patient was instructed to do modified valsalva maneuver (blow in a syringe, then leg lift). Her rhythm converted to NSR at rate of ~60 bpm after 10-15 seconds of leg lift. Pt tolerated this well and was reassured. 

30 minutes of critical care time was spent in the management of this patient.
