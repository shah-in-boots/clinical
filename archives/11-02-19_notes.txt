TTE:
Left ventricular systolic function is low normal.
Estimated EF 55%
No regional wall motion abnormalities noted.
Grade I Diastolic Dysfunction, normal left atrial pressure.
The right ventricle is normal in size and function.
The TR envelope was not adequate to calculate the RVSP.
 
Brief Presenting History:
 
ROSIE W HAMBLIN is a 59 y.o. female h|o Type 2 diabetes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity and tobacco abuse presents the ED today with moderate left-sided chest pain.  Patient states that the pain was moderate; 5-6/10.  Appears to be related with movement of the upper extremities and improved with rest.  No sweating or diaphoresis.  No recent trauma to the chest.  Patient noted to be tachycardic in the ED.  Heart rate mentioned in the 120-130s.  Patient was given some IV fluids in ED with some improvement.  She states that she drinks water at home appropriately.  No EtOH abuse.  Her only other complaint this time is diffuse muscle pain and joint tenderness multiple joints and upper extremities.  No fever chills reported.  No recent travel.  No contact with insects.  No other complaints at this time.
 
Hospital Course by Problem List:
 
#. Sinus tachycardia
- initally either due to pain or dehydration
- improved at rest and with IVF
- resolved before DC
 
#. Atypical chest pain
- has had persistent atypical, non-exertional pain of hte left chest and arms
- troponin and TTE were normal
- pain improved c- IVF as well
- likely stress related versus neuropathic, but hasn't responded to any TCA or neuropathic agent yet, nor to NSAIDs, etc
- will need additional chronic pain mgmt (I think stress at home may be the prevailing reason, her kids are having some troubles)
- can also consider giong up on the TCA
- ALA has also shown benefit in refractory neuropathic pain, but will defer to PMD
 
The remainder of the patient's medical problems were chronic and stable without any further intervention this admission. The patient will continue the current treatments and medications.

#. Acute on chronic encephalopathy
#. Vascular dementia
#. FTT c/b severe PCM
Likely multifactorial, acute worsening related to toxic metabolic from sepsis as below with superimposed delirium but with underlying vascular dementia and slow decline over last several months.  CT with severe chronic microvascular changes but no acute abnormality.
HIV-, TSH nl, RPR negative
-Continue thiamine repletion via PEG
-S/p treatment of sepsis as below
-Overall prognosis is very poor, appreciate palliative care consult.  Multiple family meetings and ongoing GOC discussions, family agreeable to hospice referrals for information only - still making final decision re stopping HD
- Palliative signed off 11/1, appreciate consult
- Awaiting SNF placement
 
#. Osteomyelits c- sepsis
Recently amputated toe is most likely source. Xrays with "First transmetatarsal amputation with marked soft tissue gas and swelling in the first digit stump associated with osseous irregularity along the surgical margin concerning for osteomyelitis." ESR 114. crp 21. WBC count 20.9. Blood cx no growth.  New low-grade fevers despite broad spectrum abx, no clear etiology as covered pretty broadly with vanc/zosyn and no localizing signs/sx.
-repeat blood cultures 10/11= neg and CXR 10/11= unremarkable
-Holding off on additional imaging with MRI non-contrast to evaluate for osteo given this would be unlikely to change management and would be v difficult to position patient given contractures
-Consulted ID, appreciate assistance
-s/p vanc/zosyn (9/28-10/14) (avoid cefe as can cause encephalopathy).  Patient completed over 6 weeks of IV abx, no indications to continue for osteo at this time
- Vascular surgery consulted on admission.  No plans for any surgical therapy at any time unless she develops a life-threatening soft tissue infection and her family would like to pursue above-knee amputation.
- GOC discussions as above
- Wound care consulted, appreciate assistance
 
#. ESRD c- HD TTS
- Appreciate renal consult, patient not tolerating much fluid removal due to hypotension. - continue HD per schedule if tolerating.  Continue GOC discussion
- Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxic meds
 
#. Anemia of chronic/renal dz c/b GIB
- Suspect multifactorial due to ACD and ESRD with recent GIB. Episode of rectal bleeding witnessed 10/3 and 10/7, CT bleeding protocol negative.  +hemorrhoids on exam.  Suspect BRBPR related to hemorrhoids, Hgb stable and pt is poor candidate for EGD/colonoscopy given overall clinical status and prognosis.
-S/p 1 unit 9/29 and 10/10 with appropriate response
-Monitor Hgb and transfuse as needed for Hgb<7

#. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
- Pt w/ complicated pulmonary issues - smoker, with Stage IV COPD, severe emphysema c/b ruptured bleb in the past and bronchopleural fistula p/f hemoptysis. Pt is not surgical candidate per outpatient pulm. CT chest this admission hows emphysematous bullous changes, bronchopleural fistula, partial collapse of left lung. No PTX appreciated per pulm. Etiology of bleed thought to be due to patient's extensive left-sided bronchiectasis with erosion into pulmonary blood vessels, which is likely going to be a chronic problem. No need for bronch given clinical stability and likely left-sided source.

ASSESSMENT and PLAN
 
Charles Brown is a 76 y.o. male with many comorbid conditions, including (N)ICM (EF 40%), HTN, cocaine abuse, dysrhythmia s/p PPM, PAD s/p bypass (on right leg). P/w reproducible pain in his PPM pocket site, and chronic pain of his right leg. 
 
#. Pain at pacemaker site
- only finding of concern is reproducible pain
- no sx of sytemic infection, no overlying rubor/calor/tumor
- will schedule APAP and see results of CT dissection protocol (looking for SST swelling/edema)
- likely DC tomorrow
 
#. Cocaine abuse
- recent use yesterday
- likely with some washout, may also explain chronic trop leak
 
#. Right leg pain d/t PAD s/p left sided bypass
- vascular surgery: pulses present, no acute interventions
- likely chronic PAD/claudication, OP f/u for potential interventions
