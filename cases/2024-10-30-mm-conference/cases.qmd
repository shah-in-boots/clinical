# *Nurse Sedate*

> AP15278336

## Course {.smaller}

- 54F h/o hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression, and chronic sinus bradycardia
- P/w worsening and progressive fatigue with chronotropic incompentence
- Previous admission with *hyperthyroidism* without change in heart rate (chronically 50s)
- Sent to EP lab for dual-chamber pacemaker
- Considered clinically stable for *nurse sedate*

---

## Complications

> It was difficult to get her completely sedated but she was sensitive to just even touching making it even more challenging to sedate her. For future procedures consider general anesthesia. 

- 6 mg midazolam
- 120 mcg fentanyl
- 10 cc bupivicaine
- 29 cc lidocaine

## Points

- Inadequate sedation should prompt consideration of rescheduling non-emergent procedures
- Language barriers intra-op should be accounted for

# *Contact Dermatitis*

> SH21103891 

## Course {.smaller}

- 73F h/o of hypertension and prediabetes
- P/w symptomatic bradycardia with episodes of lightheadedness, fatigue, and pre-syncopal symptoms (progressive)
- Consented for dual-chamber pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction
- Family present work in medicine (daughter was RN advocating for patient throughout)
- 7 days post-op was admitted through ER for worsening rash at site of pacemaker
- Thought to be infected pocket, however on review seemed to respond to topical steroids
- ID and dermatology consult agreed with *contact dermatitis*
- Patient discharged

## Complications

- Concern for pocket infection and potential lead explant
  - Closure was with 2-0 Vicryl, 4-0 monocryl, Steri-strips, and Aquacel dressing
  - Mastisol used as adherent

## Points

- Contact dermatitis can mimic pocket infection
- Allergic contact dermatitis is type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction (cell-mediated)
- Only case reports of Mastisol-induced contact dermatitis
- MAUDE adverse event report (FDA) mentions at least one Aquacel contact dermatitis case

# *Lead Dislodgement*

> MB07151335 

## Course {.smaller}

- 62F with HCM who had primary prevention dual-chamber ICD placed > 15 years prior
- Presents initially for lead extraction due to VT/VF undersensing (VT/VF event with delayed shock ~ 1 month prior)
- Lead extraction of entire system to switch from BS to MDT 
- No capsule-stitch was performed in setting of existing capsule
- Post-op day #1 had reduced slack in system
- Post-op day #7 developed left arm swelling, instructed to ER for duplex and found to have DVT
- Post-op day #10 on device interrogation had increased RA thresholds
- Roentgenography demonstrated lead dislodgement
- RA lead explanted and new RA lead implanted, with peri-osteal stitch for lead fixation

## Complications

- Lead dislodgement, although appears that RA lead remained tied to cuff and continued to pass "tug test"
- DVT in left arm (in setting of chronic venous leads on left)

## Points

- Adiposity should be considered when deciding on device anchoring strategies
- Chronic leads upon extraction may have increased risk of UE DVT

# *Phrenic Stimulation*

> JB22574806 

## Course {.smaller}

- 82F with IE s/p mechanical SMVR, AF s/p AV node ablation s/p SJM DC-PM, and most recently PICM (LVEF 40%)
- Difficulty in CS access and positioning on attempt #1 to place right-sided CS lead
- Performed repeat procedure with tunneling from left with good CS branch position, requiring general anesthesia
- Phrenic testing performed on multiple vectors with no stimulation
- Post-op in CP&R developed "rapid hiccuping"

## Complications

- Prior to case, paralytics discussed with Anesthesia
- Post-operatively, found to have significant phrenic stimulation from electrodes 1, 3, and 4
- Reviewing anesthesia case with the resident, and paralytics were given (multiple anesthesia hand-offs after 3p)
- Vector from electrode 2 was found to have adequate capture without phrenic stimulation

## Points

- Phrenic stimulation can be a complication of CS lead placement
- Intra-op testing can be limited by anesthetics and paralytics
- *Consider a disclaimer in lab about paralytics in the Anethesiology workspace, partially to help with the signficant hand-offs?*
