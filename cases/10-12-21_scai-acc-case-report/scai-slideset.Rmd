Non-invasive findings:
- ECG with normal sinus rhythm, borderline LVH
- Dobutamine stress echocardiogram with normal LV function at rest
- Severe inferior, anterior, lateral apical wall hypokinesis at stress

Diagnostic angiography:
- Distal LM 50% lesion
- Extends into ostial LAD and ostial LCX, with 70% calcific lesions
- Medina 1,1,1 category
- Mid-LAD with 50% focal lesion
- Nonobstructive disease of RCA

_Given large, significantly calcified LCX, favored a 2-stent strategy with plaque modification to both branches, followed by DK-Crush after stenting mid-LAD lesion. Shockwave was used to leave both wires in place._

### Hospital Course

- Day 1: Admitted to hospital for worsening gangrene requiring amputation
- Day 3: Diagnostic angiography performed for pre-operative risk stratification
- Day 6: Successful revascularization of bifurcation disease after surgical turn-down
- Day 7: Taken to operating room for above-knee amputation
- Day 14: Discharged from hospital to sub-acute rehab center

### Learning Points

- OCT imaging to help identify heavily Ca++ lesions
- Shockwave, versus atherectomy, allows for initial ballooning to access distal lesions with $\downarrow$ embolization or proximal complications 
- Shockwave, versus orbital atherectomy, allows wire position maintenance
- Effective modification of $360^{\circ}$ Ca++ 
- DK Crush with Shockwave allows for $\uparrow$ safety, $\downarrow$ procedure duration, and $\downarrow$ complexity compared to traditional atherectomy approach
