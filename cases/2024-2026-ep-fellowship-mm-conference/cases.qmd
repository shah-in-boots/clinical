# AP15278336

> September 2024  
> Nurse sedate case  
> Inadequate pain/analgesia provided despite medications  

## Course {.smaller}

- 54F h/o hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression, and chronic sinus bradycardia
- P/w worsening and progressive fatigue with chronotropic incompentence
- Previous admission with *hyperthyroidism* without change in heart rate (chronically 50s)
- Sent to EP lab for dual-chamber pacemaker
- Considered clinically stable for *nurse sedate*

---

## Complications

> It was difficult to get her completely sedated but she was sensitive to just even touching making it even more challenging to sedate her. For future procedures consider general anesthesia. 

- 6 mg midazolam
- 120 mcg fentanyl
- 10 cc bupivicaine
- 29 cc lidocaine

## Points

- Inadequate sedation should prompt consideration of rescheduling non-emergent procedures
- Language barriers intra-op should be accounted for

# SH21103891 

> September 2024  
> Developed rash at site  
> Concerned for early pocket infection  
> Final diagnosis of contact dermatitis  

## Course {.smaller}

- 73F h/o of hypertension and prediabetes
- P/w symptomatic bradycardia with episodes of lightheadedness, fatigue, and pre-syncopal symptoms (progressive)
- Consented for dual-chamber pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction
- Family present work in medicine (daughter was RN advocating for patient throughout)
- 7 days post-op was admitted through ER for worsening rash at site of pacemaker
- Thought to be infected pocket, however on review seemed to respond to topical steroids
- ID and dermatology consult agreed with *contact dermatitis*
- Patient discharged

## Complications

- Concern for pocket infection and potential lead explant
  - Closure was with 2-0 Vicryl, 4-0 monocryl, Steri-strips, and Aquacel dressing
  - Mastisol used as adherent

## Points

- Contact dermatitis can mimic pocket infection
- Allergic contact dermatitis is type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction (cell-mediated)
- Only case reports of Mastisol-induced contact dermatitis
- MAUDE adverse event report (FDA) mentions at least one Aquacel contact dermatitis case

# MB07151335 

> October 2024  
> Lead dislodgement case  
> VT/VF undersensing with syncope for primary prevention device  
> Reduced slack post-op with eventual atrial lead dislodgement  

## Course {.smaller}

- 62F with HCM who had primary prevention dual-chamber ICD placed > 15 years prior
- Presents initially for lead extraction due to VT/VF undersensing (VT/VF event with delayed shock ~ 1 month prior)
- Lead extraction of entire system to switch from BS to MDT 
- No capsule-stitch was performed in setting of existing capsule
- Post-op day #1 had reduced slack in system
- Post-op day #7 developed left arm swelling, instructed to ER for duplex and found to have DVT
- Post-op day #10 on device interrogation had increased RA thresholds
- Roentgenography demonstrated lead dislodgement
- RA lead explanted and new RA lead implanted, with peri-osteal stitch for lead fixation

![New RA lead, re-positioned RV lead](cxr-new-device.png)


## Complications

- Lead dislodgement, although appears that RA lead remained tied to cuff and continued to pass "tug test"
- DVT in left arm (in setting of chronic venous leads on left)

## Points

- Adiposity should be considered when deciding on device anchoring strategies
- Chronic leads upon extraction may have increased risk of UE DVT

# JB22574806 

> October 2024  
> Re-do CRT-P case for pacing induced cardiomyopathy  
> Paralyzed during procedure  
> Significant phrenic stimulation afterwards  

## Course {.smaller}

- 82F with IE s/p mechanical SMVR, AF s/p AV node ablation s/p SJM DC-PM, and most recently PICM (LVEF 40%)
- Difficulty in CS access and positioning on attempt #1 to place right-sided CS lead
- Performed repeat procedure with tunneling from left with good CS branch position, requiring general anesthesia
- Phrenic testing performed on multiple vectors with no stimulation
- Post-op in CP&R developed "rapid hiccuping"

![Post-tunneling](picm-cxr-post-tunneled-device.png)

## Complications

- Prior to case, paralytics discussed with Anesthesia
- Post-operatively, found to have significant phrenic stimulation from electrodes 1, 3, and 4
- Reviewing anesthesia case with the resident, and paralytics were given (multiple anesthesia hand-offs after 3p)
- Vector from electrode 2 was found to have adequate capture without phrenic stimulation

## Points

- Phrenic stimulation can be a complication of CS lead placement
- Intra-op testing can be limited by anesthetics and paralytics
- *Consider a disclaimer in lab about paralytics in the Anesthesiology workspace, partially to help with the signficant hand-offs?*

# YT20270503

> August 2024  
> Post-generator exchange, device therapies not reset appropriately  
> Received multiple inappropriate shocks  

## Course

- 62 year old with ASD repair at age 9 with sternotomy
- NICM, LVEF 30%, with prior AF/AFL and AF ablation c/b RMCA CVA, and LVEF recovery by 2018
- Generator change in 07/2024 with DFT testing, 17J termination of R-on-T VF induction
- Device settings not changed afterwards, with VF zone set at 150 bpm

## Complications

- VF zone was set at 150 bpm (settings made during DFT, but not subsequently changed)
- Received inappropriate shocks x 7 during domestive violence dispute
- Presented to ED in Wyoming $\rightarrow$ VT 170 and VF 210

## Points

- Device interrogations post-operatively require confirmation with likely close-loop-communication

# DC19428945

> November 2024  
> Shocks for VF after device *turned off* for comfort care  
> Magnets not available in ICU   
> Required second device interrogation to correct  

## Course {.smaller}

- 67M with ICM (LVEF 40%) with VT s/p CRT-D, AF, HTN, and ILD 
- Presents to MICU for acute/chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
- Worsening ILD on top of ADHF
- [Consult]{.red} for withdrawal of care and device interrogation (to turn off therapies)

---

## {background-image="dc-first-interrogation.png" background-size="contain"}

## Complications

- Patient had device interrogated and therapies turned off
- After, had continual grimacing and "jumping" in bed, consistent with device therapy
- No magnet was available on MICU, and patient received multiple defibrillation events

## {background-image="dc-second-interrogation.png" background-size="contain"}

## Points

- Magnets should be available on every crash cart and in multiple places on an ICU floor
- Device interrogation resources should be readily available to general fellows to help in common scenarios

## {background-image="th-dermatology-consult.png" background-size="contain"}

## Points

- Femoral access site infections are *rare*
- Allergic reaction to surgical prep being more common
