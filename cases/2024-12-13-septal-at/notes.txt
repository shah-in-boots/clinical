CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR VISIT: SVT
 
HX OF PRESENT ILLNESS:(incl location, severity, timing, assoc s/s, etc.)
Mr. T0370 is a 59 year old male with PMH significant for T2DM, BPH, Depression, 
Peripheral Neuropathy, and tachycardia. SVT initially noted while on monitoring 
for his umbilical hernia repair in 9/2023.  He had an event monitor post-surgery 
and was found to have many episodes of SVT lasting as long as 2 mins. He had an 
EP Study on 2/15/2024 which showed short episodes of SVT but nothing amenable to 
ablation due to brief duration of about 3 to 4 secs.

He is doing well with the Toprol XL 12.5mg daily and doesn't have much 
tachycardia or palpitations. He has brief lightheadedness on occasion when he 
stands which only lasts for a few secs.

He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.

 Fellow = Shaw
 
 Details:
 
 Informed consent and timeout was performed before procedure start.  The
 patient was prepared in the usual sterile fashion.  Electroanatomical
 mapping was performed using the ESI mapping company.  When left-sided,
 heparin was given to maintain an ACT between 303 50 using a combination of
 bolus/infusion.
 
 Central venous access was obtained bilaterally with 2 on each side under
 ultrasound guidance.  A 4 catheter EP study was conducted.  A coronary sinus
 catheter was put in the 7 French on the left leg, with an RV catheter placed
 and an 8 French introducer on the left leg.  Another single curve
 quadripolar catheter was placed in the HRA position through an 8 French on
 the right leg.  A dual curve CRD 2 catheter was placed at the level of the
 hiss through a 7 French on the right leg.  We performed burst pacing and
 extra stimulation protocol from atrial and ventricular positions.  After
 arrhythmia induction, with the support of isoproterenol, an ablation
 catheter was placed through an Agilis sheath after removing the HRA
 quadripolar catheter.
 
 Mapping was performed of the right atrium during sinus and during the
 arrhythmia.  Ablation was performed on the anterior septum as detailed.
 
 Additional arrhythmia mechanisms were noted. This additional arrhythmia
 appeared to be earliest on the left side and a transseptal puncture was
 performed.
 
 Transseptal puncture was performed under fluoroscopy and intracardiac
 echocardiography guidance.  The arrhythmia was induced and mapped on the
 left atrial side.  Ablation was performed on the anterior wall of the left
 atrium.
 
 Post ablation, no arrhythmia was able to be induced.  The patient tolerated
 the procedure well.  Hemostasis was obtained with manual pressure.
 
 Findings:
 
 1.  Electrophysiology study: A full catheter EP study was performed.  The
 initial sinus rhythm showed an AH of approximately 100 ms, with an HV of 40
 ms, QRS of 80 ms.  Ventricular pacing resulted in a VA Wenchkebach block of
 600/510 ms.  Ventricular ERP was less than 240 ms.  VA Wenckebach block was
 approximately 600/220.  Atrial stimulation resulted in an atrial ERP of
 approximately 220 ms.  AV Wenke block of 600/240-270.  When assessing
 Wenchebach, we used the earliest/longest coupling intervals.  The frequency
 of block increased with decrement.  During atrial extra stimulation,
 decrement was seen in AH conduction time, however no distinct jump was
 noted.  No arrhythmia was induced during initial extra stimulation or burst
 pacing.  Isoproterenol was then started at 2 mcg/min.  ParaHissian pacing
 was performed however lead to induction of arrhythmia. 
 
 2.  Arrhythmia #1 characteristics: Arrhythmia #1 had a tachycardia cycle
 length of approximately 250 ms with a VA interval of approximately 110 ms in
 a long RP fashion.  Initial attempted VOP for entrainment did not lead to or
 advance the TCL.  Atrial entrainment was attempted from the HRA position but
 due to ectopy and catheter instability was changed to CS proximal pacing. 
 Entrainment was limited due to frequent atrial ectopy and changes in cycle
 length of the primary atrial arrhythmia.  The initial entrainment from CS
 910-lead to a PPI minus TCL of 80 ms.  Distal CS atrial entrainment was not
 possible due to termination/ectopy.  Prior to ablation, repeat Para-Hisian
 pacing showed a nodal response. We treated this arrhythmia as a focal atrial
 tachycardia based on the lack of VA penetration of the atrial arrhythmia
 with robust retrograde conduction.  Delta AH was less than 40 ms also
 suggesting against atypical AVNRT.  Although there was WCT during
 arrhythmia, this appeared to be rate dependent aberrancy.  The QRS was
 narrow with a positive HV interval throughout.  No eccentric activation was
 seen however had robust AV conduction and it appeared to be a similar
 activation sequence as sinus rhythm.
 
 3.  Arrhythmia #1 mapping: As above, we treated this as a focal/Micra
 reentrant atrial tachycardia that was septal.  We mapped to the earliest a
 during tachycardia along the right atrium with the anteroseptum above the
 level of the coronary sinus being the earliest sites.
 
 4.  Ablation of arrhythmia #1: We used a nonirrigated 4 mm catheter through
 the Agilis sheath to both map and ablate the arrhythmia.  We used a
 temperature limit of 60 degrees and a power limit of 50 W.  We ablated above
 what appeared to be the tendon of Todaro focusing on 10 to 15% impedance
 drops and lack of local atrial signal in that region.  We were careful to
 map the extent of the right atrial side of the hiss which appeared to be
 over 20 mm away from our ablation targets.
 
 5.  Arrhythmia mechanism #2 characteristics: During the previous EP study we
 noted additional ectopy that appeared to be earliest from CS 5 6 which was
 in a traditional position we would occasionally get runs of this tachycardia
 which had a cycle length under isoproterenol of approximately 310 ms.
 
 6.  Transseptal puncture: Because of the left-sided earliest activation
 pattern seen, it was decided to go transseptal.  We had also mapped on the
 right side and noted there was always earlier activation in CS 5 6 then our
 roving catheter.  This transseptal puncture was complex.  Due to edema after
 ablation of the septum, visibility was somewhat limited on ultrasound. 
 Additionally, there was difficulty in finding a thin part of the septum.  We
 initially tried using the Accu cross system.  2 attempts were made which did
 not pass through the septum, but with electrocautery we were able to pass
 the wire and placed it into the left inferior pulmonary vein.  However, the
 dilator/introducer nor Agilis could pass through the septal puncture.  We
 attempted transseptal puncture again but send elevated.  We then decided to
 switch to a alternative approach.  We used a BR K1 catheter through an SLO
 sheath that we switched over wire from the Agilis.  We had the PRK needle
 connected to pressure transduction.  With this, transseptal puncture was
 facilitated and the sheath was able to cross.  The left atrial pressure was
 approximately 12.  We then brought across a multi spline grid catheter to
 induce and mapped the left atrium.
 
 7.  Arrhythmia mapping #2: The second arrhythmia mechanism was mapped in the
 left atrium.  We also incorporated data from the right atrium.  Both sinus
 and pace mapping for voltage was performed.  Arrhythmia was then induced
 with isoproterenol and burst pacing.  The activation sequence connected/in
 the pattern of arrhythmia mechanism to appear to be from the anterior aspect
 of the left atrium above the mitral valve.  This appeared to be focal and
 nonreentrant. 
 
 8. Arrhythmia #2 ablation: The grid catheter was switched for a force/vector
 irrigated ablation catheter.  We ablated during arrhythmia and cause
 cessation of the arrhythmia.  We homogenized the region of the anterior wall
 with a multiple of 40 W lesions continued until loss of EGM was noted.
 
 9.  Post ablation EP study: We performed a post ablation induction of
 arrhythmia with aggressive burst pacing under isoproterenol and off
 isoproterenol during washout.  No arrhythmia of any kind was able to be
 induced, when initially the arrhythmia was almost incessant.
 
 10.  Cardioversion of induced atrial fibrillation: The patient during burst
 pacing eventually degenerated into atrial fibrillation for several minutes.
  He tolerated this well from a hemodynamic perspective but we were unable to
 continue the study in this fashion.  The patient was electively cardioverted
 with a synchronized shock at 100 J successfully.
 
 Summary:
 
 Successful ablation of 2 focal atrial tachycardias, 1 from the anteroseptum
 of the right atrium and 1 from the anterior wall of the left atrium just
 above the annulus.  These arrhythmias appear to be somewhat linked in that
 the tachyarrhythmia would alternate between activation patterns during EP
 study.  The patient was noninducible afterwards even with aggressive burst
 pacing.
 
 Recommendations:
 
 -Follow-up in EP clinic in 3 months
 -Okay to continue all home medications including beta-blocker
 -Watch overnight to monitor vascular access
 -Postop ECG on arrival to floor
