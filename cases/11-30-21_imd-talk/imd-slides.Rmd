# Conclusion

.left[
The highly calcific nature of the ostial LAD benefited from IVL in the setting of a STEMI. The patient did well afterwards, with no further chest pain. Formal echocardiography with anterolateral hypokinesis and LVEF of 25%. Discharged with cardiac rehab, beta blockade, RAAS inhibition.
