CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR VISIT: evaluate or ablation

HX OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Fandell is a 78 year old MALE with HFimpEF 
(diagnosed 1/2019, EF<10% 2/23/2021, improved to 40% 5/2023 on GDMT) secondary 
to NICM (LHC 3/3/2021 with nonobstructive CAD) complicated by cardiogenic shock 
and VT storm requiring inotropes and MCS (ECMO+impella) in 2021, s/p dual 
chamber ICD placement (11/2020), Afib currently on Eliquis, suspected 
amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (on amio for Afib + VT suppression), prostate 
cancer diagnosed in 2023 s/p chemoradiation and currently on hormone suppressive 
therapy (leuprorelin), left renal artery stenosis (>60%), HTN, HLD, and hiatal 
hernia. Here today to follow up with EP regarding possible PVI and PVC ablation 
and coming off of amiodarone since he completing radiation therapy for prostate 
cancer. 

We saw him last on 11/8/2023 via VVC to evaluate for PVC ablation. At that 
time we discussed option for possible ablation in detail and he was interested 
and wished to pursue, however he had a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and 
was starting radiation treatment so decision was made hold off on ablation at 
that time and re-evaluate after his radiation therapy was complete. 

VVC follow up today. He is feeling well overall, he finished radiation treatment 
for prostate cancer which lasted for about a year. He continues on hormone 
treatment. States it has been a long recovery, and he is still recovering, but 
overall doing much better. He has been on amiodarone for about 4 years for AF 
and PVCs, would like to be able to come off of it if possible. 

At our last visit, we reviewed his previous monitor results and saw he had >15% 
PVC burden in 5/2023 after stopping amiodarone. He had not had AF on device 
checks at that time. Reviewed last device remote transmission in Vista from 
8/1/2024. <1% AF burden. He is scheduled for device check next week in Boise. 

Repeat echo on 9/13/2024 in Boise. Results are in Vista imaging: 
        -EF moderately reduced at 35-40%. Left atrium mildly dilated, right 
atrial borderline dilated. Mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. 

Reviewed EKGs from Boise for May 2024 and May 2023 with Dr. Shelton. PVCs felt 
to be likely RVOT, reasonable to pursue ablation. 

Discussed risks and benefits of ablation. Discussed procedure in detail of AF 
and PVC ablation as well as discussed risks and benefits. He would like to 
proceed with scheduling ablation in SLC.

Mr. Fandell is a 78 year old male veteran with PMH significant for HFrEF 
secondary to NICM (LHC in 2021 with nonobstructive CAD; s/p ICD (SJM/Abbott DC 
ICD) in 2020 for primary prevention), paroxysmal afib on apixaban, VT storm 
2/2021 started on amiodarone, hypothyroidism (?2/2 to amiodarone), HTN and 
PVCs. He was referred to EP by the HF team for management of afib and frequent 
PVCs. 

 #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
 #Frequent PVCs
        -He is due for device check in Boise next week, but looking at most 
recent remote transmission on 8/1/2024, he has <1% AF burden. CHA2DS2-VASc 
score3, on apixaban 5mg BID, amiodarone 200 mg daily, digoxin 0.125 mcg daily, 
and carvedilol 25mg BID (Medications are managed by Boise VA). Repeat echo in 
Boise on 9/13/2024 with EF 35-40%.   5/2023 event monitor showed 15.4% PVC 
burden, he was symptomatic from PVCs after stopping amiodarone on 4/1/2023. 
Symptoms improved after he resumed amiodarone. 
        -He is overall feeling well today, has completed radiation therapy for 
prostate cancer. Continues on hormone therapy. He saw HF here in SLC on 8/2/2024 
and is OK to  proceed with ablation from heart failure standpoint. 
        -discussed PVI and PVC ablation in detail, including risks and 
benefits of procedure. After discussion, he would like to proceed with 
scheduling ablation here in SLC.  We will call him to 
schedule. 

Pt evaluated with Dr. Shelton. 30 minutes spent on evaluation, and plan of 
care.
