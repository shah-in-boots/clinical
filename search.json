    "text": "Internal Medicine Residency\n\nFebruary 18, 2019 As a medical resident, we complete a senior grand rounds, a summative talk of an area of our choosing. I researched psychological triggers for sudden cardiac death, and gave a “chalk talk” style presentation. There was an associated handout and notes with references. The concept of psychological triggers as affecting the ventricular substrate is fascinating, particularly as we learn more of the role of the autonomic nervous system in cardiovascular disease.\nSeptember 26, 2018 Another bite-sized teaching mode talk on transfusions in sickle cell. Gave this talk again on October 4, 2018 at the Southern Hospital Medicine conference as an example of alternative teaching methods.\nMarch 21, 2018 With literature from early-terminated trials during 2018, I gave a journal club lecture on the updated guidelines on thrombectomy for ischemic strokes. My notes for it serve as a reference and series of citations, with a handout to improve viewer interaction. The largest issue I find was in the interpretation of their Table 1 showing non-adjusted odds ratios for an ordinal scale, listed next to a P-value.\nMarch 15, 2018 As a resident, there is a shift into becoming a teacher to both medical students and near-peers while being a learner as well. A significant amount of residents actually develop critical failures in the learning process. Here is an approach I presented, with supporting literature and an outline to be shared.\nFebruary 28, 2018 I gave a bite-sized teaching mode talk on treating rashes. The purpose of this style of talk is to explain and actually teach a topic in less than 8 minutes. Giving the talk itself emphasized learning how to teach."

Given his young age, surgical aortic valve replacement is probably favored. His STS PROM is 1.7%. If TAVR is chosen he will need a TAVR protocol CTA of chest, abdomen and pelvis. I will refer him to be evaluated by cardiac surgery and then we will have a heart team meeting and decide the best route to go. I discussed this with the patient and his wife and they expressed understanding."

In light of the above, I would like to recommend that the patient would obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram and see his cardiologist, Physician, so that we can assess his severity of his mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis and regurgitation more thoroughly. If the patient had evidence of severe mitral regurgitation, then I would strongly recommend considering him for open-heart surgery and mitral valve repair or replacement, at the time of which we will address the aortic pathology as well."

    "text": "Hospital course\nMaria D Valdez is a 69 y.o. female with PMH of ESRD s/p DDKT 2018 due to HTN and SLE c/b lupus nephritis, afib on apixaban, IDDM, hypothyroidism, T6-T7 meningioma s/p meningioma resection and laminectomy, and CAD s/p PCI to LAD 1/28/23 who presents from OSH for further management of gross hematuria and recurrent UTI. Pt presented to OSH for chest pain and was found to have STEMI and had PCI placed in LAD and was started on DAPT in addition to home medication of apixaban. Developed gross hematuria and also had some minimal bleeding from access site at groin which had resolved.\nWorkup revealed UA concerning for UTI, per documentation culture was growing E. Coli and was started on CTX then switched to nitrofurantoin 100mg BID once susceptibilities came back at NW OSH (1 day worth of it). Escalated to impenem here due to concern for ESBL without susceptibilities in hand. Transplant ultrasound without signs of pyelo but there is mild hydronephrosis  Per documentation urology was consulted and signed off since hematuria was resolving and likely from DAPT. Goal was to have patient start losartan but appears blood pressure was low end of normal so this was held and carvedilol was also decreased to 3.25 mg BID. Eliquis has been held since gross hematuria began, but DAPT continued because of high risk given very recent stent placement. Immunosuppressives were continued.   Overall pt feels well and that she is recovering. Reports having worked with physical therapy while at the OSH. States that all day today her urine was not bloody. Denies dysuria. Has had purewick in place. Of note pt tested positive for COVID while at OSH but has remained asymptomatic, she is fully vaccinated.    MEDICINE TEAM E COURSE: Escalated to impenem here due to concern for ESBL without susceptibilities in hand. Per ID, de-escalated to nitrofurantoin for appropriate coverage (last day 2/9). Diuretics were held per transplant nephro given possible transplant rejection noted at OSH. Apixaban was continued to be held on admission in setting of gross hematuria, with apixaban restarted on 2/5.   On 2/6, patient was noted to have desaturated to 84-86% on RA. Saturating appropriately on 2L O2 NC. CXR obtained showing pulmonary edema, IVF were stopped with plan to diurese if no signs of improvement.   When seen in the AM, patient was noted to be hypoxic, desaturating to the mid-80s on 2L O2 NC, improved to low 90s on 6L. Patient endorsed chest pain with exertion that had started overnight. EKG w/ possible ST depressions, troponin elevated to 1900, though difficult to interpret in setting of recent STEMI (last troponin &gt;25000 at OSH on 1/29). It was identified that DAPT had not been re-ordered upon admission. Cardiology was consulted, who recommended urgent cardiac cath and transfer to CCU.   CCU COURSE (2/7-2/11): Transferred to CCU, had cardiac cath w/o evidence of stent thrombosis. Briefly hypotensive after cath requiring levophed, now weaned off. Intubated given hypoxemic respiratory failure 2/2 to volume overload, extubated 2/9 now on room air.   TTE on 2/8 showed EF of 29% with RWA, LV mural thrombus. Patient was initially on triple therapy but descalated to Plavix and Eliquis as DAPT. Pt’s AKI initially improved after diuresis but worsened in setting of GI losses from diarrhea on 2/10. Felt to be iatrogenic 2/2 medication side effect for constipation. S/p 500 cc bolus NS. Currently holding ACE/ARB given AKI.   Medicine Team A Course (2/11-2/13): Patient had some hematemesis/hemoptysis with suctioning and went for EGD on 2/12 without an identifiable bleeding lesion. Bleeding thought to be in setting of intubation trauma and has now resolved. On 2/13 AM patient with mild acidosis, worsening LFT and AKI c/f continued congestion and IV depletion. Acute liver workup and transplant nephrology consulted. Patient with decreasing urine output and downtrending Na to 118, necessitating ICU care per Dr. Tang, attending transplant nephrologist. Prior to transfer patient was made NPO since we would like to fluid restrict her (food is ok) and we started a sodium bicarb drip to correct her acidosis.   MICU 2 Course (2/13- 2/14): Patient transferred to MICU for management of moderate hyponatremia to 120 and AKI (kidney transplant 11/9/18) likely cardiorenal etiology with EF 30% given sacral edema and pulmonary congestion on CXR. POCUS on arrival to MICU demonstrated moderate circumferential pericardial effusion which is larger than noted posterior pericardial effusion on TTE from (2/8). She was diuresed and Cardiology was contacted regarding the effusion where pericardiocentesis was done with 600 cc of bloody fluid with hemodynamic changes suggestive of pericardial tamponade. Of notes, ventricular tachycardia with successful synchronized cardioversion, biventricular overload with normal C.O., and Severe LV dysfx c/w free wall rupture. Patent LAD stent. Transfuse PRBC in lab with plan for cardiac surgery with repair of free wall rupture. R IJ accessed and swan catheter placed. Transferred to OR under cardiothoracic surgery now s/p pericardial window, intubated and on norepinephrine/epinephrine. Accepted and Transferred to CCU service.   CCU course (2/14-2/17) Per transplant nephrology, pt continued on sodium bicarbonate drip for acidosis and AKI for 1 day. Given concern for volume overload, pt then started on CVVH, D5W added on to prevent sodium from overcorrecting. Pt had worsening lactic acid, started on imipenem and infectious workup sent. Repeat TTE obtained which was similar to prior with EF &lt;20%. Hepatology consulted for worsening LFTs concerning for ischemic hepatitis, recommended supportive care. Pt had worsening INR, started on IV Vitamin K and given FFP. Also noted to have thrombocytopenia, 2 units platelets given and HIT workup sent. Started on dobutamine drip 2/15 given worsening urine output. UOP did not improve, but patient was weaned off norepi, and lactate began to normalize, with LFTs peaking in the thousands presumable secondary to resolving shock liver. Patient overall appeared stable, and eventual transfer for durable LVAD was discussed with advance cardiology providers at NMH.   On the morning of 2/17, patient self-extubated and was comfortable on room air, awake/responsive. Pulmonary pressures and lactate had also been improving on dobutamine 2.5, with CVVH pulling 50mL/hr for cardiogenic shock with oliguric patient. Around 11:30am, patient entered Vtach rhythm and pulse was lost. She received CPR and 1mg epi was given prior to ROSC. Sinus rhythm devolved into recurrent Vtach and patient was shocked. Subsequent rhythm was also irregular and devolved into asystole. During this interval, patient was reintubated. During second code, she received another 1mg epi and further CPR was provided. ROSC was obtained again with sinus rhythm, stable. Despite full oxygenation via ventilator, she was saturating in mid 70s, and dobutamine was restarted after previously being held over concern it might have contributed to the initial arrhythmia. Saturation recovered, and norepi was initiated at 40, with appropriate BP obtained. POCUS demonstrated severely reduced LVEF ~10%, similar to prior. Given initial Atach, she began amio loading. Patient’s son was at bedside and requested full code until his sister arrived.   Upon the daughter’s arrival, she and her brother were given the option of pursuing transfer to NMH for possible LVAD, but after discussing, they elected palliative extubation and comfort care. They reported that the patient had previously expressed her wish not to be reintubated, and felt the decision best reflected the patients goals for care when last decisional. Patient was extubated around 5pm with family present and prompty passed away. Family declined autopsy."

This AM paged that patient has not been feeling well, poor urine output and he is V-paced at 60 bpm.\nTTE 2/4/23: 1. Ventricular wall thickness is mildly increased. There is normal global left ventricular function. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction by visual estimate is 60%. 2. There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position (bioAVR, 23mm Carpentier Edwards; placed 1/26/23). Bioprosthetic leaflets not well seen, though appear to be normally thin and mobile consistent with normal leaflet function. Mean gradient 26 mmHg and peak velocity of 3.5 m/s and acceleration time around 95msec and DI 0.45 suggestive of patient prosthesis mismatch. 3. There appears to be very eccentric, mild-moderate bioAVR regurgitation that is likely periprosthetic, seen along the mitral-aortic continuity. 4. There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position (bioMVR, 25mm Carpentier Edwards, placed 1/26/23). Bioprosthetic leaflets not well seen, though there appears to be some leaflet thickening and reduced excursion of one of the leaflets. Elevated mean transmitral diastolic gradient 6 mm Hg at a HR of 60 bpm. 5. There is a small highly-mobile echodensity seen along the ventricular surface of the bioMVR measuring approximately 7mm in length and 3mm in width (i.e. image 34); similar echodensity not well seen on prior TTE 1/30/2023 or TEE 1/31/2023. Differential includes residual chordal structure (not seen on prior echos) or possibly a new vegetation. Consider further evaluation with TEE if clinically indicated. 6. Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is elevated at 55 mmHg. 7. IVC size is dilated with &lt;50% collapse consistent with an RA pressure of 15 - 20 mmHg. 8. There is a large, mostly posteriorly-located pericardial effusion measuring only about 0.5cm in diameter anteriorly at end-ventricular diastole and and approximately 2.6 cm in diameter posteriorly at end-ventricular diastole in the parasternal long axis view. Limited study to evaluate for respiratory changes, though no clear significant intracardiac hemodynamic compromise (no clear chamber collapse) from this predominantly posteriorly-located pericardial effusion.\nMr. Powell is a 58 year old AA M admitted to ICU with the following:\nVolume overload Stage C chronic systolic HF with preserved EF, NYHA class III-IV symptoms AKI in setting of prior kidney transplant in 2015 on immunosuppression, pHTN\nmod-severe calcified AS with moderate AI s/p 23mm Carpentier Edwards Bioprosthetic AV on 1/27/23 mod-severe MR s/p 25mm Carpentier Edwards bioprosthetic MV on 1/27/23 Patient-prostheis mismatch mild-mod periprosthetic regurgitation CHB s/p Boston Scientific SC-ppm 2/1/23 Long standing persistent Atrial Fibrillation large posterior pericardial effusion\nImpression: discussed with Dr. Avitall with EP and increased patient’s back-up ventricular rate to 80 bpm with hopes to augment CO. From EP perspective, we are limited in further optimizing device as it is single lead ppm. Patient also seen and assessed with Dr. Ibrahim. Low concern that there is tamponade physiology from the posterior effusion and that the bioprostethetic valves are responsible for the current issues. He is clinically volume overloaded and out diuretic strategy thus far appears to be suboptimal. No stigmata of cardiogenic shock at this time.\nRecommendations: 1. Please increase our lasix dosing and frequency to lasix 80mg BID for goal urine output of 1-2 L in 24 hours. If patient is not achieving this goal, we will need to increase to a lasix drip +/- thiaxide diuretic such as metolazone.

He received 1 platelet intraop. He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was noted to be baseline bradycardic after surgery and EP was consulted for PPM which was placed on 2/1. Transplant nephrology was consulted given patient had a kidney transplant in 2016. Post operative echo showed large left atrial appendage thrombus and patient preferred to be anticoagulated with eliquis. GI was consulted for intermittent bloody stools and thought likely to be internal hemorrhoids and deferred colonoscopy to 3 months post discharge. Aspirin held and eliquis continued given risks of stroke remain high given size and location of thrombus, hemoglobin and hemodynamics remained stable and concern for large bleed were low. Pacemaker set to 80 BPM to help with cardiac output. Ongoing diuresis with IV lasix given patient had enlarged IVC on echo. On 2/14 patient underwent pericardial window with drainage of 650cc of serosanguineous fluid and immediate improvement in hemodynamics. Renal function continued to improve. Sleep medicine consult was placed as RN noticed patient would snore and desaturate at night- patient preferred to do sleep study after discharge. Patient was deemed stable for discharge. Extensive time was taken to explain discharge instructions to both patient and wife. Numbers were given in the event patient would need to contact the team prior to follow up visit 2/21/2023."
