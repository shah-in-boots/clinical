This is a repository purely for theme-based files. This allows for maintaining different customizing files in a single location that can be submodule'd into a repository. This allows me to avoid having to change every single repository whenever an update is made. 

Why? Symlinking directly won't transfer over to github because the file structure *isn't the same*. Submodules seem to allow for this instead.
