[VVI?]{.bigger}

. . .

I'm a single-chamber device [sitting in the RV]{.green}. If I see the ventricle beat, I will stay quiet and [inhibit]{.light} my pacing. If I don't see anything, I will [pace]{.red} the ventricle.

. . .

[AAI?]{.bigger}

I'm a single-chamber device [sitting in the RA]{.green}. If I see the atria beat, I will stay quiet and [inhibit]{.light} my pacing. If I don't see anything, I will [pace]{.red} the atria.

. . .

[DDD?]{.bigger}

I'm tricky. I do both. I'm listening [in both chambers]{.green}. If I don't hear the atria, I will [pace]{.red} the atria, and if I don't hear the ventricle, than I will [pace]{.red} the ventricle.  

## Telemetry

::: {.callout-important}
Pacer spikes do not mean pacing!
:::

- Atrial pacing may look like a normal P wave
- RV pacing will look like a LBBB pattern, since the left-side will activate **late**
- Biventricular pacing will look like both a LBBB and RBBB (hard to tell!)
- Left bundle area pacing will look more like a RBBB pattern

# Indications

## Transvenous pacemakers

- Single-chamber pacemaker
  - Ventricle-only: used in the case of AV block that is intermittent, e.g. low pacing burden expected
  - Atrial-only (less common): used if disease limited to the SA node, e.g. no problems with AV node)
- Dual-chamber pacemaker
  - Have one of the above indications but expect an increased pacing burden
  - Allows the device to "track"...
    - If there is 2:1 AVB, hard to get the heart rate up to go for a run
    - If the device can track the atria, can increase the ventricular rate to match

## Leadless pacemakers

Leadless pacemakers tend to be used when we want to avoid additional wires/leads in the veins reaching the heart, and decrease amount of hardware (i.e. endocarditis/infection).

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
### MICRA

- VR: paces only in the RV, but has a rate responsive mode
- AV: tracks the atria by "hearing" the mechanical motion of the atria and tricuspid valve
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
### AVEIR

- Can be placed in atria alone, ventricle alone, or both
- Communicates through a wireless system to help track
- E.g. allows for similar functionality as a transvenous dual-chamber pacemaker

## Cardiac resynchronization devices

- CRT-P and CRT-D devices
  - Used when expecting a high ventricular pacing burden in a "sick" heart with significant conduction delay, like LBBB in setting of reduced LVEF
- Conduction system pacing
  - Pacing the septum, and attempting to directly capture the left bundle, leading to a more "normal" cardiac conduction pattern
  - Used for resynchronization therapy, either directly or as a bail-out (EP-dependent)

## Defibrillators

- RV defibrillator lead
  - Placed in the RV 
  - Used for both pacing and defibrillation
  - Placed from the left to create a better vector across the heart (similar to defibrillator pad placement)
  - Requires low amounts of energy to successfully shock
  - Can also provide ATP (fast pacing to *outrace* a ventricular tachycardia)
- S-ICD
  - Places a suprasternal lead and a lateral can underneath the skin or muscle on the side of the chest
  - Allows for defibrillation without need for intracardiac wires
- EV-ICD
  - Places a *substernal* lead and a lateral battery
  - Can shock at lower voltages than an S-ICD and deliver ATP therapy

# Complications

---

- Pneumothoraces
  - Whenever accessing the subclavian vein (less common with axillary or cephalic)
  - **CXR immediately after procedure, along with following morning**
- Pocket hematomas
  - Worsened by being on heparin (vs. all other AC agents)
  - Increases risk for infection if not addressed
- Femoral bleeding
  - For leadless devices, venotomy is >20F
- Lead dislodgement:
  - Although rare, occurs most commonly in first 24-48 hours
  - Can be seen on CXR, but also with device interrogation (change in pacing pattern suddenly)
- Phrenic stimulation
  - More common with CS leads 
  - Intermittent and positional "hiccups"
