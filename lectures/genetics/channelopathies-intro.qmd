# Introduction {background-color='{{< brand color primary >}}'}

## Objectives {.smaller}

1. Recall the fundamental mechanisms behind arrhythmogenesis
1. Recognize the inherited arrhythmia syndromes 
1. Predict effects of gain-of-function and loss-of-function on action potential durations
1. Know potential pharmalogical treatment strategies based on mechanisms

. . .

[*...We are trying to understand the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and treatment mechanism from a basic cardiac electrophysiology perspective.*]{.center}

# Arrhythmia Mechanisms {background-color='{{< brand color primary >}}'}

---

![Antzelevitch 2011, CEC](antzelevitch-2011-arrhythmia-mechanisms.png)

## Three major mechanisms

1. Re-entry, both functional and anatomical
1. Enhanced automaticity, usually with *less polarized* resting membrane potential
1. After depolarizations, both early and late

---

![Varro et al. 2021, Physiological Review](varro-2021-after-depolarization-reentry.jpeg)

## Action potential

- Resting membrane potential is approximately -90 mV
- Peak depolarization potential is approximately +30 mV
- Generally... $\downarrow Na^{+}$ & $\uparrow K^{+}$

## Antiarrhythmic drugs 

*Vaughn-Williams Classification*

1. Sodium channel blockers
1. Beta blockers
1. Potassium channel blockers 
1. Calcium channel blockers

::: aside
The *Sicilian Gambit* is an alternative that is worthy of reading - ESC in 1991
:::

::: {.notes}
VW classification is limited because of overlap in effects and mixed effects of drugs. Also, excludes other related medications like ivabradine and digitalis. The *Sicilian gambit* however is more complex but thoroughly groups AADs by actions.

## RE-/DE-polarization hypotheses

- RVOT fibrosis due to decreased connexin 43
- Spatial dispersion
- Phase 2 reentry
- Quinidine effects on both $I_{Na}$ and $I_{to}$

A 30 year old newly-wed man was brought to clinic by his partner because he "stopped breathing at night". Was a swimmer in college and remains physically active. Resting heart rate in the 50s.

The long QT syndromes comprise of *3 major types* and many other *minor* types

1. $LQT1 = KCNQ1 \Longrightarrow \downarrow I_{Ks}$
1. $LQT2 = KCNH2 \Longrightarrow \downarrow I_{Kr}$
1. $LQT3 = SCN5A \Longrightarrow \uparrow I_{Na}$

. . .

T-wave morphology differs between these major types based on the underlying ion channel

A woman in her 20s presents for several episodes of syncope. She notes having episodes of muscle weakness following exercise. 

. . .

On exam, her heart rate is in the 70s. She has a short stature. Mild clinodactyly of digit 5 on both hands is noted. Her electrolytes are normal.

- Anderson-Tawil Syndrome, LQT7 - arguably a long **QU** syndrome
- $I_{K1}$ occurs predominantly during phase 4
- Phase 4 represents the baseline polarized resting membrane potential
- Loss-of-function in KCNJ2 leads to decreased $I_{K1}$ current, raising resting membrane potential

A 18 year old is referred to your clinic for evaluation prior to participation in athletics. As a child, he was diagnosed with exercise-induced epilepsy had had refrained from further exertional activities. 

. . .

Baseline QTc is 390 ms. An exercise stress test is performed, and during phase 3 develops bigeminy that persists for several minutes into rest.

. . .

Genetic testing returns positive.

CPVT mimics LQT1 from a history perspective, but the underlying mechanism is through $Ca^{++}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

- CPVT1 is through *leaky* $RYR2$ channels
- Flecainide blocks both $Na^{+}$ as well as $Ca^{++}$

. . .

Calsequestrin, triadin, and calmodulin are rarer subtypes of CPVT.
